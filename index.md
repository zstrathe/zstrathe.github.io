<h2>Business Capstone Data Visualization Project</h2>

Term Project for GENBA 890: Business Capstone

* As team coordinator, led student team in consulting with a client company to provide research findings into data visualization methods, and developed visualization dashboard implementations that provide greater insight into the status of their nationwide supply chain, utilizing both Python and PowerBI
* I cannot share the deliverables due to confidential data used in this project; however, the presentation linked below is a summary that was presented at the K-State College of Business Graduate School Advisory Council Meeting on May 4th, 2022, which includes randomized data used in the recommended visualization examples
