#### Link to Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/deepsat-sat4

#### To run [the main data processing notebook](https://github.com/zstrathe/zstrathe.github.io/blob/master/code/cis731/cis731_model_training_and_evaluation.ipynb):
	- recommend a minimum of 64 GB memory and 16 CPU cores (the specs of the Google Cloud VM that I used)
	- dataset .csv files need to be uploaded to the directory where the notebook is being executed 
		- X_test_sat4.csv
		- X_train_sat4.csv
		- y_test_sat4.csv
		- y_train_sat4.csv


#### To run [the visualizations notebook](https://github.com/zstrathe/zstrathe.github.io/blob/master/code/cis731/cis731_visualizations.ipynb) showing predictions and images:
	- Can be run in a free Google Colab instance
	- Upload predictions file 
		- to Colab working directory
		- or to Google Drive and use google.colab.drive.mount (as implemented in the notebook)
	- Predictions file link: https://www.mediafire.com/file/p6kb8s4q2p92ig0/6_predictions.csv/file
