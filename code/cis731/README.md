## Python Code: Satellite Image Classification Project

#### Link to Kaggle dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/deepsat-sat4](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/deepsat-sat4)

#### To run [the data processing, model training, and model evaluation Python notebook](https://github.com/zstrathe/zstrathe.github.io/blob/master/code/cis731/cis731_model_training_and_evaluation.ipynb):
- recommend a minimum of 64 GB memory and 16 CPU cores (the specs of the Google Cloud VM that I used)
- dataset .csv files need to be uploaded to the directory where the notebook is being executed 
	- X_test_sat4.csv
	- X_train_sat4.csv 
	- y_test_sat4.csv 
	- y_train_sat4.csv


#### To run [the visualizations Python notebook](https://github.com/zstrathe/zstrathe.github.io/blob/master/code/cis731/cis731_visualizations.ipynb), for showing predictions and images:
- Can be run in a free Google Colab instance
- Upload predictions file 
	- to Colab working directory
	- or to Google Drive and use google.colab.drive.mount (as implemented in the notebook)
