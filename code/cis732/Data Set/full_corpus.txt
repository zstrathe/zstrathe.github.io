I'm built like you are
I have a dress and a train
Your snake cold lips
Make a harsh straight line
That echoes through my brain
You're perfect
Let me lift a glass high
Let me follow in your footsteps
Let me follow in your sigh
Let me follow in your sigh
I'm a woman who likes men
But this is something else
I've never felt such stirrings
I feel like I
Was someone else
I wish you'd tie me up and beat me
Crush me like a kick
A bleeding strap across my back
Some blood that you could kiss
Oh kiss away, oh kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
Tie me with a scarf and jewels
Put a bloody gag to my teeth
I beg you to degrade me
Is there waste that I could eat
I am a secret lover
I am your little girl
Please spit into my mouth
I'm forever in your swirl
You're heartless and I love that
You have no use of me
But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
And then insert a fist, an arm
Some lost appendage
Please open me I beg
You are my goliath
You are my goliath
And I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Open and release me
I love you in my head
Oh kiss away kiss away
Kiss away kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away
Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same
(Come tomorrow) will I be older
(Come tomorrow) maybe a soldier
(Come tomorrow) may I be bolder than today
Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands
(Come tomorrow) will I be older
(Come tomorrow) maybe a soldier
(Come tomorrow) may I be bolder than today
Soon I hope that I will find
A seed within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind

What we talking 'bout? 'Cause I ain't got time
For what people be talking 'bout all the time
What we talking 'bout? Fiction or we talking 'bout fact?
You talking 'bout fiction? Hold up, pardon my back
I'm talking 'bout life (Life, life)
And all I hear is, "Oh yeah, he keeps talking 'bout crack"
I ain't talking 'bout profit, I'm talking 'bout pain
I'm talking 'bout despair, I'm talking 'bout shame
I ain't talking 'bout gossip, I ain't talking 'bout Game
I ain't talking 'bout Jimmy, I ain't talking 'bout Dame
I'm talking 'bout real shit, them people playing
What is you talking 'bout? I don't know what y'all saying
People keep talking 'bout, "Hov, take it back!"
I'm doing better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothing cool 'bout carrying a strap
'Bout worrying your moms and burying your best cat
I'm talking 'bout revenge while carrying his casket
All teary-eyed, 'bout to take it to a mattress
I'm talking 'bout music, I ain't talking 'bout rap
You talking 'bout who's hot, I ain't talking 'bout that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map
They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
I see what y'all talking about, ha ha
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?
Chyeah, still they can't focus on them, they be talking 'bout me
Talking 'bout what I wear, talking 'bout where I be
Yeah, check out my hair, these ain't curls, these is peas
Peasey head still get paid, I'm combing through Gs
Please, we ain't focused on naps
'Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map
A small part of the reason the President is black
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
Talking 'bout progress, I ain't looking back
You know I run track, try not to get lapped
People keep talking 'bout Hov left 'em flat
Tryna rewrite history, let's talk about facts
Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps
He could've made more but he ain't sign his contract
As far as street guys, we was dealing crack
That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack
Grown men, want me to sit 'em on my lap
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
I repeat, you can't sit on my lap
They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?
Blueprint 3
And now that that's that, let's talk about the future
We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther
Now you could choose to sit in front of your computer
Posing with guns, shooting YouTube up
Or you could come with me to the White House, get your suit up
You stuck on being hardcore, I chuck the deuce up

They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?
They say
They say
They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday
They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
But if there is a God, we need Him now
"Where is your God"
That's what my friends ask me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come...
Tell me people
Why can't they say that hate is 10 zillion light years away
Why can't the light of good shine God's love in every soul
Why must my color black make me a lesser man
I thought this world was made for every man
He loves us all, that's what my God tells me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come...
But in my heart I can feel it, yeah,
Feel His spirit wow oh woo...
Feel it, yeah, feel His spirit...
I... can't say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
But if so let all be pure at heart
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray
Let God's love shine within to save our evil souls
For those who don't believe will never see the light
"Where is my God" - He lives inside of me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come...
No people, "where is your God?"
Inside please let Him be
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come...
But if you open your heart you can feel it yeah yeah
Feel His spirit, yeah
Feel it, feel His spirit, wow oh wow...
Feel it, you can feel His spirit
I opened my heart one morning and
I sho nuff could feel it yeah yeah
Feel His spirit yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit
The adventures of GREGGERY PECCARY!
Oh, here comes GREGGERY,
Little GREGGERY PECCARY
The nocturnal gregarious
Wild swine...
A peccary is a little pig with a white collar that usually hangs around between Texas and Paraguay, sometimes ranging as far west as Catalina
Catalina, Catalina, Catalina!
This particular peccary is part of that bold...
Bold...
New...
New...
Breed...
Breeding...
That distinguishes itself by markings which resemble a WIDE TIE directly below the white collar
If it's wide enough
Everyone will know
That the tie I'm wearing
Is a symbol
Of how nimble my mind will know
Ooh-ooh!
(Swank suave!)
Hoon-hoon hoonna-han
Hoonna hoonna
Look out!
Here he comes again!
Oh here comes GREGGERY PECCARY
Yes it's cravy, cravy, yeah...
Hoonna-han
Hoonna-han
Every morning, GREGGERY drives his little red Volkswagen to the ugly part of town where they keep the Government Buildings.
Voodn, Voodn!
Boy it's so hard to find a place to park around here!
Voo-voo-voo-nya-hoon
GREGGERY PECCARY takes the elevator up to the eighty-third floor of a grim, gray, evil-looking building with a sign on the front reading: 'BIG SWIFTY & ASSOCIATES, TREND-MONGERS'.
And what, might you ask, is a TREND MONGER? Well, a TREND MONGER is a person who dreams up a TREND (like 'The Twist' -or 'Flower Power'), and spreads it throughout the land, using all the frightening little skills that Science has made available!
And so it was, one fateful morning, GREGGERY PECCARY made his way through the Steno Pool...
Hi Mildred!
Hello Gladys!
WANDA!
Yes, from the moment they laid eyes on him, all the girls in the BIG SWIFTY Steno Pool KNEW... here was a nocturnal, gregarious wild swine ON HIS WAY UP... a PECCARY of Destiny, Adventure and ROMANCE...
Is there any mail for me?
SWIFTY'S!
THIS IS BIG SWIFTY'S!
AT BIG SWIFTY'S WE ALL KNOW-OW-OW
(WO-WO)
YOU'LL GO
FOR ANY GIMMICK OR GIZMO!
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER BE INVOLVED
IN A SERIES OF COLORFUL
TIME-WASTING TRENDS?
AIR HOCKEY... biff... dush-h-h!
LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA
YOUP YOUP YOUP YOUP
IS YOUR WIFE SNORING BY THE SINK?
LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA
YOUP YOUP YOUP YOUP
AIN'T YOUR LIFE BORING, DON'TCHA THINK?
YOUP YOUP YOUP-YOUP-YOUP YOUP YOUP
LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER
WHEN THERE'S SOME LITTLE SOMETHING
TO DO!
Does it matter that this waste of time is what makes a LIFE for you? Hmmmmm?
I must plummet boldly forward to my ultra-avant laminated, simulated replica-mahogany desk, with the strategically-placed, imported, very hip water pipe, and the latest edition of the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG, and rack my agile mind for a spectacular new TREND, thereby rejuvenating our limping economy, and providing for bored & miserable people everywhere some great new 'THING' to identify with!
WE HAVE GOT THE LITTLE ANSWERS
TO THE THINGS
THAT MIGHT BE BOTHERING YOU!
WE HAVE GOT YOUR LITTLE TOYS!
(WE'RE BUSY MAKIN' 'EM!)
BUSY MAKIN' 'EM,
WE'RE BUSY MAKIN' 'EM
BUSY MAKIN' EM
JUST FOR YOU!
Yoo-hoo-hoo!
Highly efficient, Miss Snodgrass!
And with that, GREGGERY turned and strode nonchalantly into his dinky little office with the desk and the catalog and the very hip water pipe, and proceeded, with a vigor and determination known only to piglets of a similarly diminutive proportion, to single-handedly invent THE CALENDAR!
With his eyes rolled heaven-ward, and his little shiny pig-hoofs on the desk, GREGGERY ponders the question of ETERNITY (and fractional divisions thereof), as mysterious ANGELIC VOICES sing to him from a great distance, providing the necessary clues for the construction of this thrilling new TREND!
SUNDAY
Sunday?
WOW!
SUNDAY, SATURDAY... TUESDAY THROUGH
'MONDAY - MONDAY'!
SUNDAY, SATURDAY
And thus THE CALENDAR, in all of its colorful disguises was presented to the bored & miserable people everywhere!
GREGGERY issued a memo on it, whereupon the entire contents of the Steno Pool identified with it STRENUOUSLY, and WORSHIPPED IT as a WAY OF LIFE, and took their little pills by it, and went back 'n forth from work by it, and paid their rent by it, and before long they were even having BIRTHDAY PARTIES IN THE OFFICE by it, because NOW, AT LAST, GREGGERY PECCARY's exciting new invention had made it possible for everyone to find out HOW OLD THEY WERE!
What hath GOD wrought?
Unfortunately, there were some people who simply DID NOT WISH TO KNOW, and that's why, on his way home from the office one night, GREGGERY was attacked by a RAGE OF HUNCHMEN!
Making his way through the evening traffic, GREGGERY notices that the other vehicles which crowd and bump his little red car are all inhabited by slowly-aging 'VERY HIP YOUNG PEOPLE.'
They appear to be casting sinister glances toward him through their glinting acid burn-out eyeballs, trying to run him off the road, or make him bump into something... giving strong evidence of HOSTILE AGGRESSION!
To elude them, GREGGERY takes the SHORT FOREST EXIT off the expressway. They zoom after him in all manner of cars, trucks, garishly-painted buses, and motorcycles.
GREGGERY takes a bumpy trail off the main SHORT FOREST ROAD, which leads him up the side of a FAMOUS (and conveniently placed) MOUNTAIN, and into a strange cave on the edge of a cliff, not far from a LITTLE TWISTED TREE... with eyes on it.
Meanwhile, the enraged HUNCHMEN (and HUNCH-WOMEN) rumble through the SHORT FOREST until (realizing the little swine has escaped), they decide to park their steaming vehicles in a circular pseudo-Wagon Train formation... and have a LOVE-IN!
Under the influence of a fantastic amount of TRENDY CHEMICAL AMUSEMENT AID, they proceed to perform lewd acts, rip each other off for small personal possessions, and dance with depraved abandon in the vicinity of a six-foot pile of transistor radios (each one tuned to a different station).
WHAT?
The HUNCHMEN finally expire from exhaustion, and GREGGERY, who has viewed the proceedings from a safe distance, breathes a sigh of relief...
Phew!
Only to be terrified once again by a roar of immense laughter...
HO! HO! HO!
Which seems to be rumbling up from the very depths of the cave in which he has hidden his car!
Good Lord! What was that?
GREGGERY doesn't realize he has concealed himself inside the very mouth of
HO! HO! HO!
BILLY THE MOUNTAIN!
HO! HO! HO!
And, as you all know, whenever BILLY laughs, rocks and boulders hack up, and the air for miles around is filled with tons of dust, forming a series of huge BROWN CLOUDS!
WHO IS MAKING THOSE NEW BROWN CLOUDS?
WHO IS MAKING THOSE CLOUDS THESE DAYS?
WHO IS MAKING THOSE NEW BROWN CLOUDS?
BETTER ASK A PHILOSTOPHER 'N SEE WHAT HE SAYS!
GREGGERY stops at a gas station and makes a mysterious phone call...
IS THIS THE OLD LOFT
WITH THE PAINT PEELIN' OFF IT
BY THE CHINESE POLICE
WHERE THE DOGS ROLL BY?
IS THIS WHERE THEY KEEP
THE PHILOSTOPHERS NOW,
WITH THE RUGS & THE DUST,
WHERE THE BOOKS GO TO DIE?
HOW MANY YEZ GOT?
SAY YEZ GOT QUITE A FEW,
JUST SITTIN' AROUND THERE
WITH NOTHIN' TO DO?
WELL I JUST CALLED YEZ UP
'CAUSE I WANTED TO SEE
A PHILOSTOPHER BE
OF ASSISTANCE TO ME!
GREGGERY receives information that 'The Greatest Living PHILOSTOPHER Known to Mankind' is currently in possession of the very information in question, and, furthermore, this information could be HIS, if only GREGGERY would attend a 'SPECIAL THERAPEUTIC GROUP ASSEMBLY' (Classes now forming), and available at a special low low introductory fee... and now, here he is, 'The Greatest Living PHILOSTOPHER Known to Mankind', QUENTIN ROBERT DeNAMELAND! Take it away!
Folks, as you can see for yourself, the way this clock over here is behaving, TIME IS OF AFFLICTION! Now this might be cause for alarm among a portion of you, as, from a certain experience, I TEND TO PROCLAIM: 'THE EONS ARE CLOSING'!
Make your checks payable to 'QUENTIN ROBERT DeNAMELAND, Greatest Living Philostopher Known to Mankind'!
WHO IS MAKING THOSE NEW BROWN CLOUDS?
WHO IS MAKING THOSE CLOUDS THESE DAYS?
WHO IS MAKING THOSE NEW BROWN CLOUDS?
IF YOU ASK A PHILOSTOPHER, HE'LL SEE
THAT YOU PAYS!
I'm not a one girl's guy... (Real talk for ya, peep game)
Ain't they know it, when it comes to love
I don't lie (we don't lie, man)
And the girls respect me for it (you gotta respect that)
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be opened (I may never say never)
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from (too many ladies, ha)
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour
Woo! Who you loving, who you wanna be hugging? Heh
Who you with, who you wanna be fucking?
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Now all she does is homework, I give her in house tutoring
In and out I'm moving through her student body union
And she, call me "Professor," say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
She said, I ain't no fool I'll make it up in summer school
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour
Now let the people sing
I'm trying girls out
Just trying girls out
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour
Huh, who you loving, who you wanna be fucking?
Who said what? Why you tripping, girl? Why is you fussing?
Got this model-slash-actress-slash-part-time waitress
Spend her whole day, she hanging round with part time haters
All they do is dish dirt and put her up on my latest
Itinerary, but since I tend to vary, see
I tend to carry more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
Tend to hurries in ten places at once (Woo!)
Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind, girl, and not your heart
And some day, I slow down, but for now, I get around
Like the late Makaveli or Pirelli twenty inches
Or Caine and O-Dog, stick up tape from Menace
You tell 'em chicks if they must know my business
I'm trying girls out
Just trying girls out
Put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I get off tour
I'm trying girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour
I'm looking for a Southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
Chanel under the Louie, Gucci over her booty
Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
Pretty, witty, girly, worldly
One who likes to party but come home early
Light kinda dark, short sorta tall
Slim, kinda thick, I swear I love 'em all
She can cook the coke and got hook up on the license
But she can get you first class seats for coach prices
Isn't this great? My flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
I'm trying girls out
Just trying girls out
Put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I get off tour
I'm trying girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour
I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie
And the girls respect me for it
Ain't gonna say my no can't be over
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from
I'm trying girls out (Waiting patiently)
Just trying girls out (Until I find the one for me)
What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my vein
Icicles are in my brain
Something blowing in my hair
Winter's ice, it soon was dead
Death would freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold
My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel there's no place freezing me
Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling go
Don't you think I know what I'm doing
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one that's really the loser
This is where I feel I belong
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?
Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again, again and again, and again
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All right!
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Again and again, again and again, and again
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All right!
Turn, turn me up a little bit, when that music comes in it gets loud
Swizzy!
Yes! Hands up! Hands up! Hands up high!
Hands up! Hands up! Hands up high! (La dee da da da!)
(It be very different now, Swizzy)
Hands up! Hands up! Hands up high! Hands up! Hands up! Hands up high!
(Oh oh oh!)
(I need everybody put your hands up, wave from side to side right quick for me)
Slow down Hov, you're killing 'em
Yeah, you would think I was on 'roids
I been hitting so long and I'm a big headed boy
Nah we ain't on HGH
Though I might pick up some weight when I'm running through your state
(Running through your state) Nah, nah, nah, we ain't on the clear
We on the runway in back to back Lairs (in the air)
Yeah Yeah, it's Ms. No More Drama
And Barack Obama rhymers, feel honored (talk to 'em Hov)
I put my life on these tracks
You act like y'all don't wanna pay me for the facts
Luckily my therapy is to rap
I just bare my soul I don't expect nothing back (get it up)
You're all welcome, long as you felt them
I was gon' get mine, you know where the hell I'm from
I'm from the bottom, so I do this from the diapers
Quick fast, turn the Big Apple into cider
I do this, I'm a writer and a rider
Spew it 'cause I'm nicer, but I do this for the lifers (tell 'em again Hov)
I'm a writer and a rider
Spew it 'cause I'm nicer, but I do this for the lifers, you're welcome
To all of y'all keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Yeah, now everybody get yo' hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Slow down Hov, you're killing 'em
Yeah yeah, you probably never see again
Somebody so deadly via the pen (no, never, no)
Viva Hovito, my nino, muy bien
Big up to Biggie and Pac, I do it for them
Until I reach Colleek, I do it for him
Do it for those who can't do for self due to the pen
May these bars reach through your bar
And Ma, when Mary sing it heals your heart (hands up!)
God so Lisa Stansfield you are
Love Is A Battlefield, we all get scarred
I put my heart into this
This is much more than marketed music
The reason I got a market to do this
As there's people going through pain, I'm just walking 'em through this
(I'm here for you) This ain't no marketed music
People going through pain, I'm just talking 'em through it, you're welcome
To all of y'all keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Yeah, now everybody get yo' hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Slow down Hov, you're killing 'em
If it wasn't for your love it would all be a dream
And you made our dreams come true
That's why y'all don't need to thank us
'Cause we do this all for you (talk to 'em Mary!)
We know what you were going through
Because we were going through it too
When no one seems to understand
We were always there to hold your hand
Sure I taught you 'bout watch brands and watch bands
I also said, "Watch the man hopping out of vans"
I ain't only teach you about Evisu
I told you how to fish and not let other niggas feed you, you're welcome
To all of y'all keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Yeah, now everybody get yo' hands up
Well, you've got me working so hard lately
Working my hands until they bleed
If I was twice the man I could be
I'd still be half of what you need
Still you lead me and I follow
Anything you ask you know I'll do
But this one act of consecration is what I ask of you
Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me
Well, you just leave me nailed here
Hanging like Jesus on this cross
I'm just dying for your sins
And aiding to the cause
Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me
Wrap my eyes in bandages
Confessions I see through
I get everything I want
When I get part of you
Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Is deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me
Ringfinger
A promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Devil's flesh and bone
Do something for me
I'm so tired I can't get to sleep
And the squeaking of the bed is right in time with the song that's repeating in my head
I just want you to know
"When I do it, I only think of you"
Now, we don't come up here because we feel like walkin' four flights at three o'clock in the morning.
Yeah.
We were up here last night. Now for us . . .
Last night?
Yes.
I wasn't here last night.
For us to continually come up to this here place every night and not show no action other than to say, yes a corrective indictment . . .
Oh, sure this is ridiculous.
We look kinda bad. I mean, let's be honest. Now if you had to give me any kinda reccomendation, or mark my word, you'll say, "Who the hell's kiddin' who? This guy's a mistake, every night, 3 to 4, 2 to 4, betwen those hours you guys are at 53 E 10 st, what are you doin' there every night? You mean you, you permit this condition to continue on without once giving a summons?" Alright, your lawyer said to knock it off! Uh, we're puttin' ourselves over backwards with these people. Do you know what we're doin'? Do you know what we're doin'?
No, tell me. Please tell me.
Alright. Well this is, if we're up here once we're up here twenty times. I know that little guy, like a, like the guy at the, like a long-lost brother. Now if we ever get called down, if this ever goes to a big explosion, and they say, "Officer, what did you do, did you issue summonses?" They get, this is all in the rekkid book, how many times we've been up here. This is all rekkids.
M-hmm.
Now if these people wanna subpoena these rekkids, they can subpoena these rekkids. An' they can find out how many times we've been. This is us on, wait! This is us alone! An' they say, "Officer, what did you do? Warn 'em? You mean to tell me you were up here about twenty times an you never issued a summons?"
There have been summonses.
Well, WE never issued em! How many summonses have you gotten for noise?
What, me personally, or the studio?
The studio! The studio.
I don't know how many, but there's a court case pending right now . . .
We've gotten one.
ONE! ONE! And how many times have I, eh, uh, hey listen! As I say, if I've been up here once I've been up here twenty times already.
Hey look, stop it, pack that stuff up, stop making NOISE you guys!
Yeah, well, I understand, he didn't know . . .
Well, who's in charge here at the studio?
Here he is.
In charge?
IN charge
He's more or less in charge
Are you in charge?
I don't run the studio, I just . . .
Alright, listen, lemme tell you one thing . . .
I'm in, I'm in charge
You're in charge at this point
Right.
My name is Patrolman Lefemine
Here, have a BUN.
Now, as of tonight . . .
Right.
You want a BUN?
If I come back here, and every night that I do come back here, I don't care who says he's in charge, I will issue a summons.
I'm issuing you a bun
An' anybody thinks it's a great joke, you can all laugh in the court.
Yeah, I issue it.
But, uh . . .
You guys ain't got one hit record by now, my goodness.
We have, we have to . . .
It takes a long time.
You know what I mean. This is ridiculous!
Are you sure you don't want one of those breakfast rolls on your way down the stairs?
Yeah . . .
You better believe that I don't want nuthin'
Who gets, who gets the summonses, is the, the organization?
Whoever it is in charge at the time. He could say Joe Blow, I don't care what kind of a name he gives me. Then if the courts decide, if they wanna know who he's takin' orders from, they'll summons that person to court. That's all there is to it.
Alright. Take care.
Right.
Okay.
Nighty-night!
Lost in the darkness,
I stray from the light.
Pray for my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night.
Blood on my conscience,
And murder in mind.
Out of the gloom, I rise up from my tomb into impending doom,
Now, my body is my shrine.
The blood runs free, the rain turns red,
Give me no wine; you keep the bread.
The voices echo in my head,
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?
Revel of evil,
Run through diving land,
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal and borrow, there is no tomorrow,
For the sinners will be damned.
Ashes to ashes.
You cannot exhume a soul,
Who do you curse when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust,
Leaves you empty and unwhole?
When will this nightmare be over, tell me?
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer,
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?
To safeguard my philosophy until my dying breath,
I transfer from reality unto a living death.
I empathize with enemies until the time is right
With God and Satan at my side, from darkness will come light
I watch the rain as it turns red,
These riddles that live in my head,
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
Do you believe a word of what the good book said?
Or is it just a holy fairy tale and God is dead?
God is dead. God is dead. God is dead. God is dead.
Right!
But still the voices in my head are telling me that God is dead.
The blood pours down, the rain turns red.
Look at how they stop and stare
As if they've never seen a heart in love
And though I see them I don't care
Cuz, I'm too busy thinking bout our love
Thinking about that each and every morning
I wake up to that love glow in your eyes
And though it seems I'm hooked on this fixation
I will not stop my daydreaming
Until my nights are true with you
Ooh baby, my love is on fire
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine
Listen at me call your name
As if you're witness to my every word
And though it seems sometimes insane
Something within me tells me they'll be heard
So I wait so patiently the moment
When my love fantasies will come to life
And all I need from you is confirmation
Then I'll be living truth, those moments
That I long with you
Ooh baby, my love is on fire
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine
On flute, Hubert Laws
And all I need from you is confirmation
Then I'll be living truth, those moments
That I long with you
Ooh baby, my love is on fire
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine
Ooh fire
Ooh fire Ooh fire
I want to feel your love
Feel your love mixed with mine
Can't cha feel the fire burning?
Can't cha feel the pulsation of my heart?
Can't cha feel the fire burning?
Yeah yeah, mixed with mine
Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears
He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would `pear
Junior sighed, as his hands reached out to the sky
Junior cried, the day that his best friend died
Yeah!
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye
Junior's eyes, they couldn't disguise the pain
His father was leaving, and Junior's grieving again
Innocent eyes watched the man who had gave everything
Junior's sorrow, who knew what tomorrow would bring?
Yeah!
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye
Junior's eyes looked into the skies once more
Now he knew well, this life was hell for sure
He desperately tried, his fingertips stretched to the stars, yeah
Reaching for reason, along with the time and the stars
Yeah!
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye
She comes along
She gets inside
She makes you better than
Anything you've tried
It's in her kiss
The blackest sea
And it runs deeper than you
Dare to dream it could be
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
Wave goodbye
To what you were
The rules have changed
The lines begin to blur
She makes you hard
It comes on strong
You've finally found
The place where you belong
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
She will not let you go
Keeps holding on
She will not let you go
Keeps holding on
This time, I'm not coming back
She will not let you go
This time, I'm not coming back
She will not let you go
Whilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl I'd spy
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the chicken song
Ching-a-ling song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Ngh...
...and the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
...and with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
...and the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one
...and my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lie but still I roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam
I see the look of evil in your eyes
You've been filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deed
You will bear someone else's bitter seed
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Now I know just what you're looking for
You want me to claim this child you bore
Well you know that it was he not me
And you know the way it's got to be
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Wickedness lies in your moistened lips
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
Black cat sleeps on top of your stained bed
You sure wish that you could see me dead
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Where's the pain in the violent night?
I'm depressed by the grin
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted violin
It's the nature of being
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell bad from wrong
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
Where the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell good from bad
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by
Hawk, who goes yonder?

She's mostly gone some other place
I'm getting by in other ways
Everything they whispered in our ear is coming true
Watching you drown, I'll follow you down
I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky have finally arrived
I am staying right beside you
I tried to stay away, just in case
I've come to realize, we all have our place
Time, time has a way, you know, to make it clear
And I have my role in this:
I can't disappear or leave you here
Watching you drown, I'll follow you down
And I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky are waving goodbye
And I am staying right beside you
Only thing I've ever done
Ticking time is running out
Closest I have ever come
Ticking time is running out
Oh, so tired on my own
Ticking time is running out
Best days I have ever known
Ticking time is running out
Yesterday I found out the world was ending
Yesterday I found out the world was ending
A little more
Every day
Falls apart and
Slips away
I don't mind
I'm okay
Wish it didn't have to end this way
These four walls are closing in
Ticking time is running out
Oh, all the things that might have been
Ticking time is running out
Watch young lovers walking by
Ticking time is running out
God forgive me if I cry
Ticking time is running out
A little more
Every day
Falls apart and
Slips away
I don't mind
I'm okay
Nothing ever
Stays the same
While we can
Remember when
Always were, yeah
Even then
Stay with me
Hold me near
While I'm still here
I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself
You are a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
Give it up
You don't speak
You don't judge
You can't leave
You can't hurt me
You're just here for
Me to use
I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself
I know you well, better than one might think
I know you better than I know myself
I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you best, better than one might think
It's time for you to make a sacrifice
It's time to die a little. Give it up
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself
A part of me
Got no place to go
(I'm tired of walking
Up and down the street all by myself)
No love left for me to give
(I tried and tried
But no one wants me the way I am)
Why should I pretend I like
To roam from door to door
Maybe I'll just kill myself
I just don't care no no no more
Because
I'm not satisfied
Everything I've tried
I don't like the way
Life has been abusing me
Who, I said who would care
If I was gone
(I never met nobody
Who'd care if I was dead and gone)
Who, I said who needs me
To care for them
(Nobody needs me
Tell me why should I just hang around?)
Why should I just sit and watch
While the others smile
I just wish that someone cared
If I were happy for a little while
Because
I'm not satisfied
Every little thing I've tried
I don't like the way
Life has been abusing me
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangster, ain't no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion, losing my religion
Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16s
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfucking prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down
Heaven or Hell, the cards we been dealt
Are the cards that we play, play, play
Die for what you believe, only one god recedes
When the shots spray, spray, spray
He saw the world, dim with the glow of the vertical sun
His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying
Misguided mortals you'll burn with me,
Spirit of man, cannot be freed
When death calls - this is the hours of dying
When death calls - the spirit of man can be freed
When death calls - there's no tomorrow
When death calls - just an evil shadow
Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer
For I believe, Satan lives, in the souls of dying
Misguided mortals you'll burn with me,
Spirit of man, cannot be freed
When death calls - heaven is closer
When death calls - feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When death calls - here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
When death calls - you're gonna burn
Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh in the face of death or your tongue will blister
Can't die until Satan says, you die
And Satan takes your soul
In the face of death or your tongue will blister
Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh in the face of death or your tongue will blister
Can't die until Satan says, you die
The Devil takes your soul
With all his wrath he calls the reper
When death calls - this is the hours of dying
When death calls - the spirit of man can be freed
When death calls - there's no tomorrow
When death calls - just an evil shadow
When death calls - feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When death calls - your gonna burn, burn, burn
When death calls - heaven is closer
When death calls - I can feel it, gonna take you down
Was she never there?
Was she ever?
Was it air she breathed?
At the wrong time
All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing, "Come to me."
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life
Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh-oh
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life
Was she ever?
Was she ever here?
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life away
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life away
Oh-oh
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all over - all over now people
Can't you feel it all over
Come on let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody - all over people
So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home
You understand? You know, once you memorize a sentence
It's like an exercise
Y'all niggas can't be serious right now
I'm the all time heavyweight champion of flowers
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now:
Best flow, most consistent, realest stories
Most charisma, I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter! Holla!
I jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring
That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter, 'round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me "Hova"
I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds so when the nerds asleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death
And I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (run), pull up in a drop (pull up)
Push up on my money (push up), I'm in great shape dunny (woo!)
I keep jacks jumping, thirty six sets
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats, all white trainers
The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina, Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
The fifth, a dead lift if niggas don't want to get shot
Then y'all niggas better squat, I drop your set for rep
No need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet
Lyrical exercise, y'all niggas ain't tired right?
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(And) four, breathe easy
One (and, and, and) one

Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(And) four, breathe easy
One, two, three, four, breathe easy
Suckers, get your weight up, not your hate up
Jigga man is diesel when I lift the eight up
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy
Your flow is brain on drugs, mines is rap on steroids
I lift every voice when I sing, my ability
Make yours look like an exercise in futility
Bring your squad, biceps, triceps, and quads
We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles
Y'all ain't real, that's y'all Achilles' heel
Same routine when you see me you know the drill
I spot ya, I lift the weight of the watch
Off your arm, remain nice and calm
Put down your things, Trinidad of the game
Know my way around your ring
No matter how many pounds you bring
It sounds like the same old thing
R-O-C is the strongest team, fuckers
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(And) four, breathe easy
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two

One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(And) four, breathe easy
One, two, three, four, breathe easy

We're the fire that remains (Turn Rell up a little bit)
We're controlling the game from now on (Ugh)

Locally accepted, Roc-A-Fella Records
Don't get it confused (Oh-oh, yeah)
Doing what we do, B. Sig. (It's the Roc, baby)
Rell, Peedi Crakk (It's the Roc, baby)
Free, Young H-O, Bleek (You understand, oh, oh)
And introducing
It's Young C (Young C!) home of Philly, young and hungry
All the girlies wanna fall in lust with me
And every hood in the world discussing me
I hit it once; when I'm done, give it up to Neef
It's Neef Buck (Neef Buck) out the cut (Out the cut, geah, geah)
All the haters wanna claim that they fuck with us
It ain't a game, niggas know that they Toys 'R' Us
They can't fuck with us, who? Soo! (Aw)
(I'm the one!) Man I'm money, hoes, clothes and shows
To do with your ho all wrapped in one
(I'm not done!) Man, I'm the shit after it's all said and done
The one to cop one, come back for another one
(Quick fast) Like rapid refund
I'm the (Grr, rrr) mean green out the money machine
(I'm not done!) I'm Omillio
In interviews, and thought you could hold Sparks in the hood?
Come here, hon'! (Chill!)
And you like it
All them haters talking shit, we don't like it
We love it, that "black mask, black glove" shit
With my Mac (Mac) and my Tec (Tec)
And my vest, just like that
For them niggas that be thinking Mack Milly
Ain't really from the streets
I'm that gallstone trapped in the belly of the beast
Those seen here we'll lead you, forever
And we will not leave you, never
And our voices will ring (Ring!) together
As one (Aw)
It's young Free!
Move, working the wheel, hand jerking the V
Busters know if you cross the line, thinking I'm off my job
But I'm on like Chris when he popped his cus'
Nigga, them slugs'll fly
Call me P.C.!
Tempers spilling, I peel, look how I'm killing the wheel
The fitted tilt to the left, the shirt blend with the sweats
Your girls skirts and veils, she undressing
Don't stare, take a picture, nigga, packing the bills
I'm the one! Young H-O, a game of none
What you think I do to the brain of that dame you brung?
It's only 40 proof, it feel like 151 when I'm done!
Make a run with the Roc, rock Air Force 1s
Through customs, cops can't bust him
It's Hov, the hustler; I'm having one hell of a run!
And you like it
All them haters talking shit, we don't like it
Nah, we love it
I got a mami with a body, don't touch it
You can't fuck with young Easy up on the Just Blaze production
You get nothing, we get enough spins
Can't stop us from copping bottles while we clubbing
It's the R-O-C forever, tell the public, huh!
Those seen here we'll lead you, forever
And we will not leave you, never
And our voices will ring (Ring!) together
As one (Aw)
Where do you go when your conscience takes over
Do you crawl to your corner and cry,
Did you imagine, that no one would notice
Just a secret to take when you die.
All the world is watching you, every tongue is
Screaming sinner.
How are your dreams, do they claw at your sleep
Making darkness a place you despise,
Where is the god, that once was your strength
Are you sure he was there from the start.
All the world is watching you, nowhere you can hide,
Every tongue is screaming sinner, only satan hears your cries.
When you sin cardinal sin, you make your bed and on it you must lie,
And your futures looking grim, but did you ever give a damn
About the child, he's running wild,
When you sin cardinal sin, don't you expect the world will treat you well,
We say oh, go to hell.
We point the finger, sin cardinal sin, laugh in your face, sin
Cardinal sin,
We point the finger, laugh in your face,
Cos you're no better than the rest of the human race.
Oh sin cardinal sin, oh sin cardinal sin.
I had a friend once he took some acid
Now he thinks he's a fire engine
It's okay until he pisses on your lighter
Kinda smells kinda cool kinda funny anyway
satan, satan, satan...
I had a friend once he took some ecstasy
Tried to marry me and every one in the room
He was sort of loving kinda caring,
kinda tried to fuck my lazy boy
It got a bit messy all over the curtains,
arm chair covers, throw pillows, and carpeting
satan, satan, satan...
I'm getting bored again...
Heh heh heh heh heh... I was there last night...
The way I feel is the way I am
I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you
Just to you
What kind of people do you think we are?
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you
Just for you
The hateful image of another man
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you
Yeah for you
The shock troopers laying down on the floor
Yeah with you
Are you devil, are you man
Yeah began
Ladies digging gold from you
Will they still dig now you're through
Yeah you're through
You bought and sold me with your lying words
The voices in the dark that you never heard came true
Yeah came true
Your fallen phallic god dismembered and gone
Yeah that's you
I beg you please don't let it get any worse
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
Yeah curse you
All of the promises that never came true
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true
Ah, that's true
Are you Satan, are you man?
You've changed a lot since it began
It began
Vultures sucking gold from you
Will they still suck now you're through
Cats, rats
The search is on, so you just better run
And find yourself another way
Rob the dead, they don't feel a thing
Leave the living for another day
Rats, rats
You are nonentity, you have no destiny
You are a figment of a thing unknown
A mental picture of a stolen soul
The fornication of your golden throne
A smiling face, it means the world to me
So tired of sadness and of misery
My life it started some time ago
Where it will end, I don't know
I thought I was so good
I thought I was smart
I feel my world is torn apart
But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind
I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know
Listen to me while I sing this song
You might just think the words are wrong
Too many people advising me
But they don't know what my eyes see
But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I feel I'll blow my mind
The neon lights are shining on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night, through the night
If I could find one then everything would be alright
The sleepy city is dreaming the night time away
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale, yes for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me coming, You've got me going around
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
Walking the streets I wonder will it ever happen
Gotta be good 'cause then everything will be OK
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day...
You didn't try to call me
Why didn't ya try, didn't ya try
Didn't ya know I was lonely?
No matter who I take home
I keep on callin' your name
And you...
I need you so bad
You're The One, babe
Tell me, tell me
Who's lovin' ya now
'Cause it worries my mind,
And I can't sleep at all
I stayed home on Friday
Just to wait for your call
And you didn't try to call me
Why didn't ya try, didn't ya try
Didn't ya know I was lonely?
No matter who I take home
I keep on callin' your name
And you...
I need you so bad
You're The One, babe
Tell me, tell me
Who's lovin' ya now
'Cause it worries my mind,
And I can't sleep at all
I stayed home on Friday
Just to wait for your call
I can't say what's right or what's wrong
But I love you
All ya gotta do is call me, babe
'Cause I want you
You make me feel
So excited, girl
I got so hung up on you
From the moment that we met,
That no matter how I try,
I can't keep the tears
From running down my face,
I'm all alone at my place
You didn't try to call me
Why didn't ya try, didn't ya try
Didn't ya know I was lonely?
(Baby... )
Why didn't ya try, didn't ya try
(I say, please!)
Didn't ya know I was lonely?
I stayed home all afternoon, man
I was working on my car
I fixed the upholstery
I fixed the seat so it would tilt back
We were going to go to the drive-in
And you didn't call me, man
I waited, it was Friday night, I remember, man
It was nine o'clock and I was sitting on home
I was still watching television and you didn't try to call me
We'd been going steady for six weeks
And... I thought you were my teen-age thrill
I thought you were my teen angel, man
But you didn't call me
I dig you so much, man, why didn't you call me
If you could have seen me in the afternoon
I was hung up, I even washed the car
I, I reprimered the right front fender, man
We were gonna go, we were gonna go out
And get some root beer afterwards, man
(Baby!)
And I was gonna show everybody my new carburettor
(Baby!)
And you didn't try to call me
(Girl!)
It's against my uniform
To be a civil judge
All the songs are history now
`Bout rock stars and their grudge
Let us cast our minds back
To thirty years or more
You took up all the vandals
Will Hitler beat `em all?
And we're sad and sorry
Really sorry that it happened that way
Yes we're sad and sorry
But why'd you have to treat us that way?
Compare ourselves with others
And cover them in sin
Oh, God what a terrible
A terrible state we're in
There must be some way out of here
A comprimise that's right
If we cannot work it out
We're gonna have to fight
Yes we're sad and sorry
Really sorry that it happened that way
Yes we're sad and sorry
We cannot go on in those days
I'm talking about my brothers
Yeah, I'm talking `bout sisters as well
I wish you good luck
Good luck!
Oh, but the world's still on fire
Chain the hope you take on, liar
This fire
We're on fire, we're on fire, yeah...
Stronzo
, stronzo di merda
I'm trying to take a nap but
I couldn't sleep overnight because of you
Ugh, you really hurted me,
Ohhhh you really hurt me
When I was high,
You called me an asshole?

Pezzo di merda
Have you ever been trying to take a nap?
My heart beats too fast
Because I'm thinking of your fucking ugly face
Youyou suck

Pezzo di merda

My baby's got
Jones crushin' love
Jones crushin' love
Jones crushin' love
Well my baby's got
Jones crushin' love
Jones crushin' love
Jones crushin' love
She don't merely fit like a glove
That little girl's got the jones
That little girl's got the Jones
That little girl's got the jones
She's tryin' to
Grind up my Jones
Grind up my Jones
Grind up my Jones
Well, she's tryin'to
Grind up my Jones
Grind up my Jones
Grind up my Jones
She don't ever wanna leave it alone
She can push; she can shove
Till it's just a nub
Just a nub
Just a nub
Here she comes
With her red dress on
Steam shoots out
From the sprinklers on the lawn
The eyes be rollin'
On the concrete fawn
The wind can't blow
'Cause the sky is gone
The wind can't blow
'Cause the sky is gone
The wind can't blow
'Cause the sky is gone
Jones crusher,
Jones crusher
Deadly jaws, better get the gauze
She's a Jones crusher,
Jones crusher
Deadly jaws, better get the gauze
So impressed with all you do
Tried so hard to be like you
Flew too high and burnt the wing
Lost my faith in everything
Lick around divine debris
Taste the wealth of hate in me
Shedding skin succumb defeat
This machine is obsolete
Made the choice to go away
Drink the fountain of decay
Tear a hole exquisite red
Fuck the rest and stab it dead
Broken, bruised, forgotten, sore
Too fucked up to care anymore
Poisoned to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care anymore
Broken, bruised, forgotten, sore
Too fucked up to care anymore
Poisoned to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care anymore
In the back, off the side, and far away
Is a place where I hide, where I stay
Tried to say, tried to ask, I needed to
All alone by myself, where were you?
How could I ever think, it's funny how
Everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now
Just like you would always say, we'll make it through
Then my head fell apart and where were you?
How could I ever think, it's funny how
Everything you swore would never change is different now
Like you said, you and me make it through
Didn't quite, fell apart, where the fuck were you?
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free fucking speech
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free fucking speech
Is the answer in his eyes?
Is the answer in her smile?
Or in the words that you first hear her say
Is it in the nick of time?
First impression in your mind
Do you know it all in just one day?
How will I know she loves me?
How will I know she cares?
It's hard for true love to find you, find you
So easy to feel you're there
How will I know she loves me?
I know all things in time
Well, I have no problem waiting, waiting
For true love forever mine
Is the answer in her glance?
The first time you're holding hands
Or in the moment that feels oh so right
Is it in her tenderness?
Or the magic of his kiss
Or in the sweet love you make through the night
How will I know she loves me?
How will I know she cares?
It hard for true love to find you, find you
So easy to feel you're there
How will I know she loves me?
I know all things in time
Well I have no problem waiting, just waiting
For true love one of a kind
For true love forever mine
In life we have our pains and sorrows
Face mountains we think we can't climb
Not thinking there's always tomorrow
You feel like giving up
You say you're out of luck
But then you hear a voice in your mind
Telling you to
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
'Til the day that life is said and done
This world is filled with peaks and valleys
With rivers we think we can't cross
Too busy keeping sorrows telling
You say you're at you're end
You say you never win
But then a light comes on in your mind telling you to
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
Until the day that life is said and done
If you wanna hold on to something
You better hold on to your dreams
If you want to hold on to something
You better hold to your love
To your love
So if they try to burst your bubble
It's 'cause they have none of their own
And when you feel you are in trouble
Hold your head up high
And feel your heart inside
And know that you are never alone
Just as long as you
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
Until the day that life is said and done
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a mother to her child
Don't let anyone ever steal your dreams from you
Hold on to your dream
And do your best to always wear a smile
(I love you, papa)
Hold on to your dream
Brooklyn, we go hard
We go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Agh!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Go hard)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
This is black hoodie rap
There's no fear in my eyes where they're looking at
Better look on map
Besides, me nah like to eye fight
Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!)
But if a man test my Stuy
I promise he won't like my reply
Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy, I may take some getting use to
Chain snatching, ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shiddit, from Brownsville to Bainbriddidge
Fatherless child, Mama pulled double shifts
So the number runners was the only ones I hanged widdith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fiddith
Fear no orangutans, piddeel ciddaps
Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous
Please! Tell me what the name of this shit
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
I father, I Brooklyn-Dodger them
I jack, I rob, I sin
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey
From Brooklyn corners, burning branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returning tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
While I'm doing my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid ten, now I paid my dues
Risk takers, we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warning
(Brooklyn!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick working like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Robbing out the commercial stash
Kill the voice screaming in my head
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the sky
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With heat rising through my eyes
Every day, your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't hurt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to Heaven before they close the door
Oh, hey, yeah
Oh, when I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
They broke the heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to Heaven before they close the door
Oh, oh, yeah
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Oh, people on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts are beating
Like pendulums swinging on a chain
When you think you lost everything
You find out you can lose a little more
I, I'm just going down the, that road feeling bad
Trying hard to get to Heaven before they close the door
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh
Oh-oh-oh
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
I'm going down the river
Going down to New Orleans
They tell me everything's gonna be alright
But I don't know what alright even means
I close my eyes and I wonder, boys
If everything is as hollow as it seems
I've been to Sugar Town, oh, shook the sugar down
Trying to get to Heaven before they close the door, hey
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven (Trying to get there)
Before they close the door (Woo, door)
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven (Trying to get to Heaven)
Before they close the door (And relive my dreams there)
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven
Before they close the door (I've been all around the world, boys)
Ooh, trying to get to Heaven
Before they close the door

The little Goblin Girls
Some are called Doreen
Some are dressed in green
They're tricking your treat
But they're bad girls
They're very bad girls
(LEPRECHAUN LIGHT...)
They make your face look like you got scales on it
But that's okay...
When the green light shines down
On the black guys in the band
Everybody in the audience
Thinks they're seeing something
That looks like it's made out of Fish skin
But Coy leaves the green gels in the truss
Because he knows the guys in the front
Really enjoy looking like they've got
Scales all over their body...
Crawled away from me.
Slipped away from me.
Tried to keep a hold,
But there was nothing I could say.
Slid away from me.
Crept away from me.
Tried to keep you down,
But there was nothing I could say.
What you trying to say?
That you don't wanna play?
What you want and what you need,
don't mean that much to me.
I can see your back is turning.
If I could I'd stick a knife in.
Love.
Crawled away from me.
Slipped away from me.
Tried to keep a hold,
But there was nothing I could say.
Slid away from me.
Crept away from me.
Tried to keep you down,
But there was nothing I could say.
What you trying to say?
That you don't wanna play?
What you want and what you need,
don't mean that much to me.
I can see your back is turning.
If I could I'd stick a knife in.
This is love.
This is love.
This is my love for you.
This is my love for you.
This is my love for you.
This is my love for you.
This is my love for you.
This is my love.

Get up.
Say, say.
Get up.
Say.
Get it, get it, get it,
Raah
What you trying to say?
That you don't wanna play?
What you want and what you need
don't make a fuck to me.
I can see your back is turning.
Eat your heart out, Steve
I want to date you maybe
I want to take you out
I want to wine and dine you
Oh I want to twist and twist and shout
I want you hard in my arms
So soft on my bed
You get the key to my heart
Oh when you wear that sweet dress
But you're too physical, physical to me
You're just too physical, physical no to me
I want your roughhouse baby
I want this right in your ear
You let me feel your danger
I let you make this feeling clear
I want the touch of your charms
The heat of your breath
I wanna say all those things
That would be better unsaid
No
But you're too physical, physical to me
You're just too physical, oh
You're too physical for me
You're too physical to me
You're really just just too just
Too really fuck no
Oh, goddammit!
You're just too physical

Oh you're too physical

"We've been... we've been trying something a little different this tour. We've been looking at one of our songs from a different angle, under a different light, so we can hopefully kind of see it almost for the first time. We'd like to try that for you tonight, is that okay? We're gonna need your help though. We're gonna need your help and your permission, so we need you to find a comfortable space, that's not only comfortable, but vulnerable. I want you to shut your eyes and go there, and we'll meet you on the other side..."
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do, we both may disappear
If I do, we both may disappear
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you as well, my dear
And you as well, my dear
Pushed you away, my dear
Pushed you away
Pushed you away
Pushed you away, my dear
I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What are you but my reflection?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?
But you're pushing, and I'm shoving you
And you're pushing me, and I'm shoving you
Rest your trigger on my finger
Bang my head upon the fault line
You'd better take care not to make me enter
If I do, we both may disappear
If I do, we both may disappear
But you're pushing, and I'm shoving you
And you're pushing me, and I'm shoving you
You still love me, you still love me
You still love me, you still love me
You're pushing, and we're shoving
And we're pushing, and I'm shoving
And you still love me, you still love me
You still love me, you still love me
You're pushing, and we're shoving
And I'm pushing, and you're shoving
And I'm slipping back into the gap again
I feel alive when you touch me
I feel alive when you hold me
Down
Slipping back into
Slipping back into
I am somewhere I don't wanna be, yeah
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never want to see that place again
Saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you, as well, my dear
If when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway
I must persuade you another way
Pushing and shoving
Pushing and shoving
Pushing me
There's no love in fear
Staring down the hole again
Hands around my back again
Survival is my only friend
Terrified of what may come, yeah
Remember I'll always love you
As I claw your fucking throat away
It will end no other way
It will end no other way
Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time...so gold
Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever...and be in time
Stay gold
But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold
Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold
Listen, uh! Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa
Ooh you so nasty, amateur pole dancing
Come and get this cash from me, they call me Rain Man
She tried to rain dance, money so long it'll drown you girl
Buried under so much stacks
They had to pull back about 50 thou before they found ya girl
I brought book bags of that bankroll, I'm a D-boy, baby they know
I'm an original D-boy, they go bankrupt if they try to keep up
No roof in my car but I got mirrors on the ceiling
I'll spread bread on the bed, ever had sex on a million?
Tell me
Listen, uh! Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa
Red light, TLC
Through the left eye, my POV
On the iChat
How's that for computer love? She rolled her eyes back
I'm like, "Ooh you're so nasty"
You turned my Maybach back seat into the Hotel De'Paris
I ain't gotta go down to the go-go
You got a private show that's like Magic City
I got stacks of fifties, I got piles of hundreds
Let's role play, act like you want it
You know, you know you hot like fire
You throw that body, I'll throw them dollars
But not them 1s and not no 5s
Have you ever seen a Grover Cleveland?
That's a thousand dollar bill, baby
Listen, uh! Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)

You know, you know, you know
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce

Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa
You know, you know, you hot like fire
As I blow, this dough, you might could retire
Take it slow like Neo, when shots was fired
In the Matrix have patience, got lots of bottles
Rock-a-bye baby Jay-Z got notes like Mariah
Got no 1s got no 5s, my D notes are higher
I'm a D boy, their decoys, their money is lighter
Than Nicole Richie, roll with me, they're on a diet baby
Listen, uh! Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)

I really like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa
This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of Bond Street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffeured cars
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs
Pariah from society
Addicted to sobriety
A product of a virgin birth
Another god on earth
Yes that's your fantasy
You say that you can read my mind
Be careful of what you might find
You think that you can be like me
And see what my eyes see
But you're no friend of mine
Do you believe every word I say?
Make your own truth, and get out of my way
I'm your pariah
For your desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah
An angel or the Antichrist
A symbol of your own device
Pathetic in your own sad way
You're just one pill away
From taking my advice
Do you believe every word I say?
Make up your mind, and get out of my way
I'm your pariah
For your desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah
Do you believe that I'm from Heaven?
That I descended from the sky?
The graven image of a pseudo icon
To worship me on high?
I'm not your saviour,
I got no wings to fly
Just your pariah
Don't look to me when your life is over
I'm your pariah
For your desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah
Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All Eternity
Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, reign perception
Grudges break your back
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!
Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardize and ruin
What have you become?
Blame the world, and blame your maker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!
Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and heaven crumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!
And if you see my friend
I thought I would again
A single thin straight line
I thought we had more time
I thought we had more time
I thought we had more
Carry me, carry me home
I thought we had
Carry me, carry me home
I thought we had
I am he
As you are he
As you are me
As we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly, I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
(Better come now) Corporation T-shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long
I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob
Mr. City
Policemen sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying
Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down
I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob
Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan
From standing in the English rain (nice tan)
I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob
G-goo goo g' joob
Expert, texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the Joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying
Semolina pilchard climbing up the Eiffel tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe
I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob
G-goo goo g' joob
Goo goo g' joob
G-goo goo g' joob goo

Here comes the water
All I knew and all I believed
Are crumbling images
That no longer comfort me
I scramble to reach higher ground
Some order and sanity
Or something to comfort me
So I take what is mine,and hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the water will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now
This ground is not the rock I thought it to be
Thought I was high
Thought I was free
I thought I was there
Divine destiny
I was wrong
This changes everything
The water is rising up on me
Thought the sun would come deliver me
But the truth has come to punish me instead
The ground is breaking down right under me
Cleanse and purge me
In the water
This is a state of emergency, bitches
What you want me to do? I'm sorry!
I'm back
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey! Uh! (Uh-huh!)

Give the drummer some
Shit, I already gave the summer some
It's the winter's turn, Hovi Hov is the coldest
I'm just getting better with time, I'm like Opus One
Young, no two alike like a snowflake
Okay, show me what you got babe
Words is slurring, engine purring
Mami front, but I'm so determined
Shots of Patron, now she in the zone
I ain't talking bout the 2-3
Mami in the zone like the homie two-three
Jordan or James, makes no difference
We all balling the same
Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recording
Nigga, you might want to fall back from recording
Shit, what you write is not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave they may applaud him
But misery, I will assure them
Aw baby, just ignore them
Truth or dare, mami, listen and learn
I got a drop, I just took off the top, it's your turn
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Justin Blaze
Blazettes
Roc-A-Fella Records
Dynasty continues, y'all die
Uh huh, peace!
Here I come again now, baby
Like a dog in heat
Tell it's me by the clamor now, baby
I like to tear up the street
And I been smokin' for so long
Ya know I'm here to stay
Got you in a stranglehold, baby
You best get outta the way
Road I cruise is a bitch now baby
But no, you can't turn me round
And if a house gets in my way, baby
Ya know I'm tearing it down
You ran the night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold, baby
Then I crushed your face.
Sometimes you wanna start higher
And sometimes you gotta start low
Some people think they gonna die someday
I got news, ya never got to go
C'mon, c'mon up...
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon up
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Road I cruise is a bitch now
Ya know ya can't turn me round
And if a house gets in my way
Ya know I'm burnin' it down
Ya ran the night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold, baby
Then I crushed your face.
I used to have a job
An' I was doin' fairly well
Depression came along
An' everybody start to yell
"Where'd they go, them good ol' days,
'An all that crap we used to sell?"
Now I'm in Hot-Plate Heaven,
at the Green Hotel
Republicans is fine,
If you're a multi-millionaire
Democrats is fair,
If all you own is what you wear
Neither of 'em's REALLY right,
'Cause neither of 'em CARE
'Bout that Hot-Plate Heaven,
'Cause they ain't been there
They really oughta go
'N find out how the hall-way smell -
They'd benefit to know
'Bout what the bums in there could tell
(I guess we're only dreamin',
But I s'pose it's just as well
That's ALL you get to dream
Up in the Green Hotel)
Nature didn't put me here,
An' neither did my fate -
It musta been some evil ol'
Republican candidate!
He's over there in Washington,
But I wish he was in HELL
'Cause I'm in Hot-Plate Heaven
At the Green Hotel
Things is slightly better now;
They hope we will forget
The misery of 'TRICKLE DOWN',
An' jelly-bean etiquette
The Regal Presidential Style
Has simply not worn well,
But neither has my rags,
Up in the Green Hotel
(I said) the Green Hotel
(I mean) the Green Hotel
(Been there once) the Green Hotel
(An' gone again) the Green Hotel
Neither has my rags
Up in the Green Hotel
Pass me the dog food!
This is how
It begins
Push it away but it all comes back again
All the flesh
All the sin
There was a time when it used to mean just about everything
Just like now
Just like now
Breathe, echoing the sound
Time starts slowing down
Sink until I drown
(Please) I don't ever want to make it stop
And it keeps repeating
Will you please complete me?
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Watch the white
Turn to red
It fills up the hole but it grows somewhere else instead
All my life
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but it just left me dead
(Well guess what?)
The world is over and I realize it was all in my head
Now everything is clear
I erase the fear
I can disappear
(Please) I don't ever want to make it stop
You can never leave me
Will you please complete me
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Never be enough
To fill me up
Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
No I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord get me out of here
(Here) (All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been
And the wheels are turning and turning
As the Twentieth Century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th Century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)
All's well, all's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are, you drive like a demon
From station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is near
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here
He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.
He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.
We're gonna miss him.
We're gonna miss him.
Yeah, so long.
We wish you well.
Told us how you weren't afraid to die.
Well, so long.
Don't cry, yeah,
Or feel too down.
Not all martyrs see divinity.
But at least you tried.
Standing above the crowd,
He had a voice that was strong and loud.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.
We're gonna miss him.
We're gonna miss him.
Yeah, no way, yeah, to recall
What it was that you had said to me,
Like I care at all.
But it was so loud.
You sure could yell.
Took a stand on every little thing
And so loud.
You could be the one who saves me from my own existence
Warn while some child might chill, nine-one-two
I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone symbol on you. So he bashes his skull through the window while looking out to the sea. Like torment of my ego. And we're amused by this
Yeah, standing above the crowd,
He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so eager to identify with
Someone above the ground,
Someone who seemed to feel the same,
Someone prepared to lead the way,
And someone who would die for me.
Will you? Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fucking lie.
Don't you step out of line.
Don't you step out of line.
Don't you step out of line.
Don't you fucking lie.
You claimed all this time that you would die for me.
Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?
He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
Come down.
Get off your fucking cross.
We need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr.
To ascend you must die.
You must be crucified
For our sins and our lies.
Goodbye...
I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart
Come on, tell me!
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be
Come on, tell me!
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have
Nice and high and far apart
Just like they said
I built this place with broken parts
Just like they said
You chip away the old version of you
You'd be surprised at what you can do
I'm safe in here
Irrelevant
Just like they said
My voice just echoes off these walls
My voice just echoes off these walls
You feel me breathe, I am watching you
I see it all
The many ways you can't get to me
I see it all
I see the hell you put yourself through
Oh the things I could do, if I wanted to
My voice just echoes off these walls
My voice just echoes off these walls
I don't need anything at all
My voice just echoes off these walls
And I just slowly fade away
And I just slowly fade away
And I just slowly fade away
You will never ever ever ever get to me in here
You will never ever ever ever get to me in here
You will never ever ever ever get to me in here
You will never ever ever ever get to me
Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall
Oh by jingo
There's no room for anger, we're all very small
Oh by jingo
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies
From paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball
Won't someone invite them
They're just taller children, that's all, after all
Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown
Oh by jingo
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down
Oh by jingo
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence
They're just older children, that's all, after all
I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred
That we're nobody's children at all, after all
Live 'til your rebirth and do what you will
Oh by jingo
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill
Oh by jingo
After all, after all
Me and my heart took a
Vow from the start and a
Vow to my heart I never break
Seasons may come and the
Seasons may go but know
Through every time and space
My love will always stay forever and always
From the bottom of my heart, I love you
I can say these words to you without delay
If you're wondering just how long I'll love you
Try forever that's how long I'll feel this way
Me and my heart got a
Promise from the stars that they'd
Keep this love burning endlessly
People will come just as
People will go but know
Whatever life has in store
Through all eternity you will have my love for always
From the bottom of my heart, I love you
I can say these words to you without delay
If you're wondering just how long I'll love you
Try forever that's how long I'll feel this way
Yes, forever is how long my love will stay
Forever is a long, long time
But so what?
Good morn or evening friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to every-body
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain
It's that

Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
Rock on, Roc-A-Fella y'all
While others spit that Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's about
Fuck y'all mean? Handling since a teen, I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine 'til the dough hit it and told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but, no bitches
Watch how I'm walking, 'cause even the thoroughest niggas be NARC'in
Trying to strike a bargain, hoping that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil, thoughts that this sport'll feed you
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch a
Freeze off my kneecap, can y'all believe that?
Got the city drinking Cristals, re-up the fee
Rappers going broke trying to keep up with me
My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder
You know this nigga: JAY-Z, Shawn Carter
G.S. the fuck up, dree-ess the fuck up
Watch me shine like a Breitling, Breguets the fuck up
All rhymers forget it like Alzheimer's
Small timers, I said it, I'm addressing all drama
Talk to me!
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
So sick of niggas
"I want money like Cosby" Who wouldn't?
This the kinda talk that make me think you probably ain't got no pudding
Niggas got them kinda dreams from jail
You in the streets, nigga, make your moves, get your mail
Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
Niggas'll roast a L, but scared to throw your toast, well
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
There's heaven, then there's hell, niggas
One day you're cruising in your 7, next day, you're sweating, forgetting your lies
Alibis ain't matching up, bullshit catching up
Hit with the RICO, they repo your vehicle
Everything was all good just a week ago
'Bout to start bitching, ain't you? Ready to start snitching, ain't you?
I'll forgive your weak ass: hustling just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars, honies that shake their ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers of MAC-millers
East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped in the station, filled up on octane, and now they're not sane
And not playing, that goes without saying
Slaying day in and day out, when money play in, then they play you out
Trying to escape my own mind, lurking the enemy
Representing infinity with presidencies, you know?
Dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
Dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
Dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
Dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get Money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse
Revolution in their minds - the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?
So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive
You must be brave
Or you children of today are
Children of the Grave, Yeah!
All right now, watch this... Let me tell you 'bout this song. This song was originally constructed as a drum solo. That's right. Now, after Terry learned how to play "The Black Page" on the drum set, I figured, well, maybe it would be good for other instruments. So I wrote a melody that went along with the drum solo, and that turned into "The Black Page, Part 1, The Hard Version." Then I said, well, what about the other people in the world who might enjoy the melody of "The Black Page" but couldn't really approach its statistical density in its basic form? So, I went to work and constructed a little ditty which is now being set up for you with this little disco type vamp. This is "The Black Page, Part 2, The Easy Teen-age New York Version." Get down with your bad selves so to speak to "The Black Page, Part 2."
Thank you.
Yeah, Frank!
Did anybody dance?
I'm drunk
And right now I'm so in love with you
And I don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do
Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car
Nothing quite like the feel of something new
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
I swear
I just found everything I need
The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins are listening to me
Well, I want to rip it up and swim in it until I drown
My moral standing is lying down
Nothing quite like the feel of something new
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
New Angels of Promise

Take us to the edge of time

I'm a blind man and she's my eyes
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd

It's always time
Hold me tight
Keep me cool
Going mad
Don't know what to do
Do I need a friend?
Well, I need one now
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All I've done
I've done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And there's little left of me
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
In red-eyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles
Pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart
I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you
Ballen von Zecken
Und alten Sporthemden, Sporthemden, Sporthemden
Lachen von Feuer
Lachen von Gummi
Lachen von Tranen
(Sheets of tears)
Ooh ooh ooh awh . . .
Lachen von getrocknetem Wasser
(Sheets of drywall and roofing)
Lachen von drywall und roofing
(Sheets of large deprived rumba)
Lachen von riesigen, tief-gefrorenen Rumba
A light shines down from heaven
A dense ecumenical bandana
At the right hand of God's big rumba
And his voice pronounceth out
In sheets of plywood
And bales of old sportshirts
And this is what he said
Beklecker nicht
Beklecker nicht
Beklecker nicht
Beklecker nicht
Mein Sofa!
And you know what that means . . .
Time will crawl
I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
'Til the twenty-first century lose
I know a government man
He saw the sun in the night
He made him fly through a hole
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst
Time will crawl
'Til our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
'Til our feet grow small
Time will crawl
'Til our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose
I saw a black, black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm, warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose
(Go!)
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep
Time will crawl
And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose
And our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
And our feet grow small
Time will crawl
And our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose
And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose
Time will crawl
For the crazy child
Time will crawl
We'll give every life
'Til the twenty-first century lose
For the crackpot notion
Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
(In your fear)
In your fear
(Seek only peace)
Of what we have become
(In your fear, seek only love)
Take to the fire
(In your fear)
Now we must burn
(Seek only peace)
All that we are
(In your fear, seek only love)
Rise together
(In your fear)
Through these clouds
(In your fear)
As on wings
This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials
Lord, will be remembered
Everything has changed
You, what you looking at?
Head down, too late for that
Know your place, don't ever forget
And this is not my face and this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here I can recognize
And this is all a dream and none of you are real
I'll give anything, I'll give anything
Hey you, what you running from?
All your hate, what you've become
Bet you didn't think, it would happen to you
All used up half way through
And this is not my face and this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here, I can recognize
And this is all a dream and none of you are real
And I'll give anything, you know, I'll give anything
Kind of hard, hard to see
When you crawl on your hands and your knees
With your face in the trough
Wait your turn, while they finish you off
Don't know when it started, don't know how
Should have found out, should have happened by now
Got these lines on my face
After all this time and I still haven't found my place
I jump from every rooftop
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all
I wake up, on the floor
Start it up again, like it matters anymore
I don't know if it does
Is this really all that there ever was?
Put the gun in my mouth
Close your eyes, blow my fucking brains out
Pretty patterns on the floor
That's enough for you, but I still need more, more, more
I jump from every rooftop
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all
I jump from every rooftop (Is this really all)
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all
I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything (A million miles away)
I don't feel anything (A million miles away)
I don't feel anything (A million miles away)
I don't feel anything
Sweet and still there's pain (pain, pain, pain)
If I would have grew up to be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same (same, same)
But since I grew up through the game
And my influence is the same
And my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed (ashamed)
And though I wish I could separate the two things
I cannot so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearing the coast up
Tight coupes like I'm wearing the roadster
For any coupe, bear-hugging the holster
Hov', alright alright
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
Once again it's the life
So I make no apologies, crooked policies
So a G a nigga gotta be
We playing for property, no Monopoly
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me
They say the child shall lead
So I take it far as I can and then we shall see
Shall we dance with the devil for a beat
I pray to God I ain't got two left feet
Do the hustle put keys in the street
Then I'm ballroom dancing
Ke-ke-ing in the suite
Sweet, BB's on the feet
TV's in the seat, enemies on the creep
It's so corrupt
Soak it up, it's a lesson, every fuck up
One day you're up
Next day you're down
Long as you stay the same it'll come back around
Hov', alright alright
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
Once again it's the life
I'm even better
I'm eating better
Best thing about it is
My niggas eating together
With each endeavor, we reaching levels
Niggas ain't seen in like forever
I'm Hyman Roth, so made all my partners rich
I can't vouch for you
If you ain't a part of this
So pardon me as I pave my wrist, uh
As I parlay my chips
Hov', alright alright
American gangster, gangster
Businesses like I'm white
But I'm not, I'm just bright
So fly with no fear of the flight, uh
So if y'all hear my plight
And if you think you can make it this far without a fight
Couple mistakes here and there
Not always right, but I'm always real
That's how I sleep at night
Hov', alright alright
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
Once again it's the life
Sweet
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long
Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name?
And you've been so long
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
And it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline
(Been so long)
(Been so long) and it's been so long
(Been so long) I've been putting out fire
(Been so long) it's been so long
(Been so long) been putting out fire
(Been so long) it's been so long
(Been so long) putting out fire
(Been so long)
Been so long (so long, so long)
Been so long (so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long
(Been so long, so long, so long)
(Been so long, so long so long)
Been putting out fire
Been putting out fire
Been so long
Been so long
And I've been putting out fire
I've been putting out fire
Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's opened if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?
Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
What I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits,
The one who waits for you....
Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you? (so I dub thee Unforgiven)
Oh, what I've felt...
Oh, what I've known...
I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven, too...
Never free...
Never me...
'Cause you're unforgiven, too...
Oh
Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine
Oh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
Using what I want
To get what you want
Oh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over 'til I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again
Oh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
And she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile
Using what I want
To get what you want
Oh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in
Ooh Sweet Amber
Ooh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
(It's never as sweet as it seems)
Ohh. Umm. Hmm.
That's how long I've been here. I've been here ever since, ever since it got dark I've been here.
How did you get in my home? This is my piano. How did you get in here?
I thought it was my piano.
It's mine.
Since when?
Since about 10 years ago its mine.
You sure?
Yes, positively.
No, it was mine.
This is a small place, you must be blind you know.
Where were you at?
Could have been one nine . . . No, it couldn't have been one-nine-oh . . .
It couldn't have been any more . . . How about try, just try 'G' . . .
How did you happen to get in here?
My mother said to me "You're a bad boy, Louis the Turkey. You'd better, you'd you you you'd better go on 'E' and stay on 'E' and you'll never see the world . . . you're a bad boy 'cause you you went to the bathroom on the floor!" you know?
Did they make you clean it up?
No, they made me eat it.
Ooh.
Woo!

Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (u-uh)
He padded his self the rap J.F.K., you wanna pass for my Jacqueline Onassis
Then, hop ya ass out that S-class
Lay back in that Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask

We got brothers full of Arm'I, mami's in Manolo
Bags by Chanel, all Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a ten, chances you're with him
If you're a five, you know you riding with them
Sick with the pen nigga, no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man twitching
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, nigga you CB-4
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the R.O.C. bitch
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket, Yao Ming!
Still smoking that la-la-la

Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the forty five

C'mon!
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit

Hold up, skip all the singing let's get right tonight mami
She playing she hate when I'm name dropping
So when I talk rap, she gon' change topics
But I got a plan "B" that's planned out, for when things don't pan out
Hov' telling ya mind brother, I'ma play shy brother
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?
Then I'ma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo
Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals
And she grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials
And she grabbed my pants, felt the potential
And I rubbed 'bout every essential
That have fun breaking her fundamentals
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millennium
Has finally stopped driving that blue Millennium
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney
And Rémy and weed, 'til she higher than helium
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la
Memphis Bleek always smoking that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the forty five

Need you
Dream you
Find you
Taste you
Fuck you
Use you
Scar you
Break you
Lose me
Hate me
Smash me
Erase me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Ladies and gentlemen
Goddammit
Let this shit knock
I done turned Havana to Atlanta
Guayabera shirts and bandannas
Every time you think they got me I switch the planner
Bulletproof this, radio scanners
(You got scanners, we got scanners)
Balling 'til they ban us
You getting too much bread, they try to jam you
Boy from the hood but got White House clearance
Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents
Politicians never did shit for me
Except lie to me, distort history
Wanna give me jail time and a fine
Fine, let me commit a real crime
I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef
Out of spite, I just might flood these streets
Hear the freedom in my speech
Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep
Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free
Except I made millions off it, you fucking dweeb
I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat
Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt
Obama said, "Chill, you gonna get me impeached."
But you don't need this shit anyway, chill with me on the beach
Y'all gon' learn today
Uh, y'all must want to start a revolution
You know whenever I'm threatened, I start shooting (Bang!)
Catch a body, head to Houston
I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans
This communist talk is so confusing
When it's from China, the very mic that I'm using
Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music
You're an idiot, baby, you should become a student
Oh, you gonna learn today
Where the fuck have you been
The world's under new management
The new role model, fuck this Zoolander shit
Y'all gon' learn today
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block
Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun
Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star
You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no,
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Na, na na...
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
because you feel your body jammin'
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, Oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
She sits in silence, in her midnight world
Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away
And as the seasons turn the days to years
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen
And now she dances only in her dreams
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
From this whole world, I try to hide my face
But from this loneliness, there's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories I know so well
I need your love more than before
I can hardly carry on anymore
My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe
My mind and soul have felt like this
Since love between us, no more exists
And each time that darkness falls,
It finds me alone with these four walls
My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe
Whereupon the house combo at the Brasserie drifts into
a modified version of one of Toad-O's big hit numbers.
BUDDY JONES stares longingly at the little nozzles
pooching out of MARY'S moistened upper clothing,
but it's too late...WARREN, one of the other guys from
Joe's Garage Band has already recognized her
(he's now one of the foremost disco-fusion rhythm guitar
players on theWetT-Shirt Circuit, currently providing
exciting strummery here in Miami), and is in the process
of getting the details of her life on the bus with LARRY
and the other jolly road crew lads. He eventually sends
JOE a letter with this infor-mation in it...
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER... Meanwhile,
Joe hears about Mary's naughty exploits. He falls in with
a fast crowd and gets seduced by a girl who works at
the Jack-In-The-Box, named Lucille, who gives him
an unpronounceable disease...
Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you
I've been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger's flame
He was Abel, I was Cain
I am here
I'm hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground
To the ground
Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
I return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you
Man has made me oh so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it's come to sweet revenge
Desperate hands
That lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soul
Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, just set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown
And I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
On my own
On my own
What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
And I won't feel afraid
No I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid anymore
Anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)
Anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)
How many tears must we cry before learning,
Things that we have they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Why do you believe that we've got something coming,
You took it all, left me standing here with nothing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,
Too fae away.
In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,
Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
All I need is understanding and the right to survive,
Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
How many tears must we cry before learning,
Things that we had they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away, too far away, too far away.
I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
It's some kind of psychedelic experience...
Our body is light, we are immortal
Our body is light, we are immortal
Our body is light, we are immortal
Our body is love, we are eternal...
Eternal...
Omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, without judgment...
Gray skies are gonna clear up
Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Ya' decide to smile!
Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that "full of doubt" look
Slap on a happy grin!
And spread sunshine all over the place,
Just put on a happy face!
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face
And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine
I knew a girl so glooming
She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing
So spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
So, put on a happy face
It's still getting worse after everything I've tried
What if I found a way to wash it all aside?
What if she touches with those fingertips
As the words spill out like fire from her lips?
If she says, "Come inside," I'll come inside for her
If she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her
I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
Inside you
Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel
As she walks me through the nicest parts of hell (bitch)
I still dream of lips I never should have kissed
Well, she knows exactly what I can't resist
And if she says, "Come inside," I'll come inside for her
And if she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her
I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
Inside you
Dear mom and dad
This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write
I'd hoped somehow to get out of this quickly so that you'd never have to know about it, but that just isn't possible now
I don't know what's going to happen, but what can I say to you? Will "I'm sorry" make a difference? Will it ease the pain?
The shame you must be feeling, forgive me, please
I'm just caught up in another of her spells
Well, she's turning me into someone else
Everyday I hope and pray that this will end
But when I can, I do it all again
And if she says, "Come inside," I'll come inside for her
And if she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her
I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
Inside you
I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
Inside you
As surely as the blade's course is run
Maybe my kingdom's finally come
There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
'Til the war come along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days
Puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
Achoo, excuse me
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket
God, it's pouring down
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Achoo!
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10 and full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes my friend
And this one here's for you
Hello, what's this? Thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, (crikey) catch pneumonia or something in this rain
Stupid little cow, ay?
Though I know that we meet ev'ry night
And we couldn't have change since the last time,
To my joy and delight,
It's a new kind of love at first sight.
Though it's you and it's I all the time
Ev'ry meeting's marvelous pastime.
You're increasingly sweet,
So whenever we happened to met
I greet you...
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and..
At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.
Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
And these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
And the words in my ears
Will resound for the rest of my years.
In the morning I find with delight
Not a note of our music is played out.
It will be just as sweet,
And an air that I'll live to repeat:
I greet you...
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and..
At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.
So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
This one, this form I hold now.
Embracing you, this reality here,
This one, this form I hold now, so
Wide eyed and hopeful.
Wide eyed and hopefully wild.
We barely remember what came before this precious moment,
Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside...
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in
This body makes me feel eternal. All this pain is an illusion.
(Keep calm, keeping it calm, keep calm. Fuck, here we go again)
Heat lighting flash, but don't blink. Misleading
Tranquility ruse
You're gonna happen again
That's what I think
Follow the evidence
Look it dead in the eye
You are darkness
Trying to lull us in, before the havoc begins, into a dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie
We know better
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
We know your nature
Blame it all on the bastards when you're blowing out
Shame on you
Shame on you now
No amount of wind could begin to cover up your petulant stench and demeanor
Calm as cookies and cream, so it seems
We're not buying your dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie
We know better
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
We know your nature
Calm before the torrent comes
Calm before the torrent comes
Calm before the torrent comes
Calm before the tempest comes to reign all over
Disputing intentions invites devastation
A tempest must be true to its nature
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
Control, your delusion
Insane and striking at random
Victim of your certainty, and therefore your doubt's not an option
Blameless, the tempest will be just that
So try as you may, feeble, your attempt to atone
Your words to erase all the damage cannot
A tempest must be just that
I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty 'cause you just got paid
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you, baby, you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh yeah
Ooh, stay for a day
Ooh yeah
Don't you dare
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
Woo!
Oh yeah
Muhammad my friend, it's time to tell the world
We both know it was a girl back in Bethlehem
And on that fateful day when she was crucified
She wore Shiseido Red and we drank tea by her side
Sweet, sweet, sweet
Used to be so sweet to me, well
Muhammad my friend, I'm getting very scared
Teach me how to love my brothers who don't know the law
And what about the deal on the flying trapeze?
Got a peanut butter hand, but honey
do drop in at the Dew Drop Inn
Sweet, sweet, sweet
Between the boys and the bees
Sweet, sweet, sweet
Between the boys and the bees
And Moses I know, I know you've seen fire
But you've never seen fire until you've seen Pele blow
And I've never seen light, but I sure have seen gold
And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine
till I get my own, honey, TV show
Ashre, ashre, ashre, ashre
And if I lose my Cracker Jacks at the tidal wave
I got a place in the Pope's, honey, rubber robe
Muhammad my friend, it's time to tell the world
We both know it was a girl back in Bethlehem
Ladies and gentlemen, here he goes, Peter Rundel, he seems to be disgusted. Whatever. Ridero ridera!

A groan of tedium escapes me,
Startling the fearful.
Is this a test? It has to be,
Otherwise I can't go on.
Draining patience, drain vitality.
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.
But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith,
And I'm still right here.
But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith,
And I'm still right here.
Wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Be patient (wait it out).
If there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through,
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
Gonna wait it out.
If there were no desire to heal
The damaged and broken met along
This tedious path I've chosen here
I certainly would've walked away by now.
And I still may, I still may be patient, be patient, be patient.
I must keep reminding myself of this.
I must keep reminding myself of this.
I must keep reminding myself of this.
I must keep reminding myself of this.
And if there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
And I still may.
And I still may.
And I still may.
And I am gonna wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.

It was early one morning, I was, on my way to school
It was early one morning, I was, on my way to school
I met a magic woman, and she broke my teacher's rule
I'm in love with that woman, before I learn to call her name
I'm in love with that woman, before I learn to call her name
The way you treat me, is doggone insane
Yes, tell me baby, honey where you stayed last night
Yes, tell me baby, honey where you stayed last night
You didn't come home, darlin' untill the sun was shinin' bright
I'm in love with that woman, before I learn to call her name

Try to speak as clearly as you can
You know
Everything gets written down
Nod your head
Just in case they could be watching
With their shiny satellite
Turn it up
Listen to the shit they pump
Into your head
Filling you with apathy
Hold your breath
Wait until you know the time is right on time
The end is near
I hope they cannot see
Living inside of me
To murder everything
I hope they cannot see
I am the great destroyer
Say your name
Try to speak as clearly as you can
You know
Everything gets written down
Nod your head

Hey pig

All of my fears came true
Black and blue and broken bones
You left me here, I'm all alone
My little piggy needed something new
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care anymore
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care anymore
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I just don't care
Hey pig
Nothing's turning out the way I planned
Hey pig

What am I supposed to do?
Lost my shit because of you
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care anymore

That old fashioned word
It's a word called love
Called love
Called love
Oh, this must be the way the nigga Pac felt when he made
Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me
Y'all niggas got me feeling like all eyes on me, me against the world
Hmm, y'all got me on my shit
Thought niggas would appreciate what I did to this game
Being that I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggas would appreciate what I came and did
Since ninety-six, every year
Something must be seriously wrong with the world
I know y'all ain't hating
(Some people hate) Don't tell me niggas is hating
(Some people hate) Uh, nah, you know what I think?
(Some people hate) I think
(I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind
Y'all got me on my shit
Raw, rough and rugged, when addressing the mass public
My attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it
Got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck being famous, I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter, my success in this game
Is sort of like Pro-jectic Justice
A payment for brushes with police officers
A peace offering from the gods for the streets I was tossed in
'Til I'm deceased in a coffin
I'ma be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon' change the numbers
It's the strengthening of chain among us
Please we ain't afraid of none of ya's; who want it with us?
Ain't nothing changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon
(Some people hate) Yeah
(Some people hate) Uh, uh, uh
(Some people hate) Yeah! You know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy
I guess it's just the penalty of leadership
I guess I'm what niggas wanna be and shit
Or niggas just bored wanna be in shit
'Fore they get to rapping, start believing it, think they're Ali and shit
I roll with the punches so I survive
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise, surprise
They try to take me out the game but I's alive
It's like a old negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
You bastards know me, the one and only
Big homie from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life
It's either that or y'all gon' make me
Put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga
(Some people hate)
(I know nigga's ain't hating man, let me find out)
(Some people hate) Jealousy is a weak emotion, man
(Some people kill their brothers)
C'mon man, be stronger than that you know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) You'll be alright though
Au contraire, nigga, I am here 'cause I earned this shit
By riding out when niggas had learners' permit
We bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
I bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out
Turn your six, I laid back in the Maybach
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggas from way back
Niggas wanna clown, but the pound, it don't play that
Get yourself found drowned where the lake at
Run up on 'em notoriously, take that, take that
And then we're coming where you wake at
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that
Face facts, fake rap cats
Can't take back what I took back to the Brook, look
Some people hate
Some people hate
Some people kill their brothers
I think they've lost their minds
And I'm hung up oh
He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath
He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive
And He haunts you
And He binds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all
You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
Cthulhu, awaken
He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes
And He haunts you
And He binds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all
You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
Cthulhu, awaken
You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
Sanity taken
Seething damnation
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Winged salvation
Death by creation
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
US bombs crusing overhead
There goes my love rocket red
Shoot it up
Blaster bomb bomb bomb ahead
Multi millions still unfed
A mondo teeno giving head
Shoot it up
Hold me shake me, I'm all shook up
Psycho maniac, interbred
Shoot it up
Shoot it up hu
Shoot it up hu
Teenage crime now fashion's dead
There goes my love rocket red
Shoot it up
Shoot it up
Shoot it up
Shoot it up
You can't say we shall and not fight through hell
You can't say we will and not dare to deal
You can't shout out peace and then vanish in the crowd
You can't ride the storm without some effect
You can't steal the spoil and not pay the debt
You can't wave a sign that spells "evil" and feel really proud
You can't sing a song with no melody
You can't say we're one without unity
You can't form a line if you're sacred to stand alone
You can't pray for grace and then smack her face
You can't speak of hope and then crack a joke
You can say you're there but time knows how much you've grown
Put a face to your somebody
Can you say your name?
Or would you rather stay unknown?
Can you show your face?
Or are you fearful of it shown?
Can you feel your heart?
Or does it beat for you alone?
Lift your glass up high
Say that your truth will never lie
If your love cannot be moved
You can't look at me and not see yourself
You can't say "for them" and not for who else
You can't truly bless and not bless the good of all
You can't serve the rich and desert the poor
You can't hear their cries and just close the door
You can't say you're down and not take it to the wall
You can't benefit from one's detriment
You can't find the serum and not cure the sick
You can't free the slave to enslave them differently
You can't see the right only from your sight
You can't see the wrong and just go along
Or is that the way you would want your fate to read
Put a face to your somebody
Can you say your name?
Or would you rather stay unknown?
Can you show your face?
Or are you fearful of it shown?
Can you feel your heart?
Or does it beat for you alone?
Lift your glass up high
Say that your truth will never lie
If your love cannot be moved
You can't make a pledge and then slip the script
You can't say the words and not move your lips
You can't be confused and still say you understand
You can't be a friend but not through thin and thick
You can't be a click but in danger split
You can't evenly share and then grab the biggest hand
You can't say you do but then show you don't
You can't say you will and make sure you won't
You can't want for change and not do what you need to do
You can't give up all and then take back all you give
You can't live to die but you can die to live
Or is that too much to ask of the you in you?
Put a face to your somebody
Can you say your name?
Or would you rather stay unknown?
Can you show your face?
Or are you fearful of it shown?
Can you feel your heart?
Or does it beat for you alone?
Lift your glass up high
Say that your truth will never lie
If your love cannot be moved
Question-time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on Mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends, always be found
And I can't, I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Now I leave them all in the never-never land
The station seems so cold, the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name, "Hi, Dave
Drop in, see you around, come back
If you're this way again"
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a longer way to go
I hope I make it on my own
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Too much in the truth they say
Keep it 'till another day
Let them have their little game
Illusion helps to keep them sane
Let them have their little toys
Fast sports cars and motor noise
Exciting in their plastic place
Frozen food in a concrete maze
You're gonna go insane
I'm trying to save your brain
I don't know what's happening
My head's all torn inside
People say I'm heavy
They don't know what I hide
Take a life, it's going cheap
Kill someone, no one will weep
Freedom's yours, just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use
You're gonna go insane
I'm trying to save your brain

She spreads herself wide open to let the insects in
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
Give it
Devils speak of the way in which she'll manifest
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
Need to contaminate, to alleviate this loneliness
I now know the depths I reach are limitless
Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-A-Fella, LOX, taking the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted
Yo, ayo, ayo, ayo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it, like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm looking for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight 'til my numbers match the Motorola bids
And walk the streets up in NY like I don't fucking care
If I ain't strapped that means I took 'em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
'Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiing, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, flooding your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted looking at Biggie posted on my wall
Taking shots of Louie 'til I fall
Nutting to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, 'til I swear Big moved
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's costing
Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggas lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mack, I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment building vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walking
Heat from the Larkin, keep on sparking
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparkling
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawking
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not trying to meet the Sergeant, at the precinct
Eating cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans
Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killing your pops
You feeling The LOX, nigga, why you grilling The LOX?
If this rap shit don't work niggas still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangsters don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggas can't deny it
Lot of cats still trying to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm opening up, or headline
Doing the speed limit or pushing red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic
Any nigga ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L-O-X
Ruff Ryder you heard? We got the game mastered
I told you the pain was coming
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell
You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggas on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me falling off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference? Either way I'm sonning your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggas coming to lose
Something to prove? Spit it, we can have a spray off
I lay off wack niggas and kill 'em on my day off
Ain't nutting for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave, bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a mil stacking nigga who pull quick, still packing
For you Phil Jackson niggas on that Bull shit
I don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lighting 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas
Shooting backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hopping in your casket
'Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spitting, let 'em know the shells hit you
I tell niggas quick, suck dick and get a Glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I Ruff Ryde and pop a fella for Roc-A-Fella
Screaming (what the fuck), spending mozzarella
I know pop you can't stand us 'cause we cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop, I popped up the antenna
Whoa watch your manners when my veins pop like Scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thing, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four dot six Range
Shit mayne, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch, flip big 'caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vein to the brain
Muh'fuckers is nodding and throwing up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak, man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money 'til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gon' stop us with your measly asses?
We don't stop at the tolls, we got E-ZPasses, nigga
Multiple cars and divas with D-Classes
Iceberg sweats with I.B. on the elastic
Shit, bitch! What the fuck, ya heard me? Hahahaha
Put some more beat on that joint
Uh, uh, uh-huh
Uh, paper chase
Bonnie and Clyde
Y'all motherfuckers know how it's going down
Gotta get that paper dog

Uh-huh uh, yeah, right, yeah
Paper chase y'all, paper chase what? Uh
Greyhound bitch, stay down bitch
'Bout to set up shop with Jay, round this bitch
Half a brick of yay, 'bout to lay down this bitch
('Til November?) Nah, I'm here to like May down this bitch
And I'm thinking, I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch
Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch
I'm trying to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch
Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six
Roll the windows down and, wave round this bitch
But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch
Gotta talk to the natives, let 'em know I'm here
For all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters
I got jobs for ya, drop Saabs for ya
More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya
Money propositions hope that's not a prob' for ya
If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (that's right!)
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uh!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta have that grab that paper dog!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that
Gotta get that paper dog
When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?
I got my two guns, I came to scoop ones
A down ass bitch and she down to click
Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with
And my plan is, not to leave this town 'til I'm rich
Gotta find a nigga selling all them ounces and shit
Tell them get down with the clique or get found in a ditch
See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit
Not to hit em, just to let 'em know the sound of shit
Return later that evening in the club with Fox
And I got the snub nose for those that love to box
I'm in search of them young niggas that hug the block
All day, 'til it's light gray outside
Shoot dice talking shit all day outside
And even when it's hot, they're outside
Let em know how it's gonna go, Bonnie and Clyde
And ayo, you would want me on your side
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uh!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta have that grab that paper dog!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that
Gotta get that paper dog
When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?
Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best
I ain't got it to give, but I got it to test
And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest
Is your time, I gotta move this in a week or less
For the next couple of days I brought out all I possess
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS
Between the driver and the passenger where the TV rest
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed 'em the cream
Picked em up in the afternoons and told 'em some things
You know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens
Yo, never lay your head where you holding them things
Keep the family then your business, nothing goes in between
Never feared no man, put four in his bean
Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uh!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta have that grab that paper dog!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that
Gotta get that paper dog
When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?
How old were you when you first let a man make love to you?
Next, who was he?
Next, how did you feel at the time?
Next, how did you feel afterward?
What did you feel, what did you think?
Were you pleased, frightened, ecstatic, disgusted?
What did he say? What words did you speak?
That's what I want to know
Now, tell me, now, now, all of it, now, tell me, yes!

Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written

To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man

Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

(Hey God)
I believed your promises, your promises and lies
Terrible lie

You made me throw it all away
My morals left to decay

The Illinois Enema Bandit
I heard he's on the loose

Lord, the pitiful screams
Of all them college-educated women . . .
Boy, he'd just be tyin' 'em up
(They'd be all bound down!)

The Illinois Enema Bandit Juice
The Illinois Enema Bandit ! heard it on the news !
I heard it on the news
Bloomington Illinois ... he has caused some alarm
Just sneakin' around there
From farm to farm
Got a rubberized bag
And a hose on his arm
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
That he just might wanna pump
The Illinois Enema Bandit
Some day he'll have to pay
Some day he'll have to pay
The police will say, "You're under arrest!"
And the judge would have him for a special guest
The D.A. will order a secret test
And stuff his pudgy little thumbs in the side of his vest
Then they'll put out a call for the jury folks
And the judge would say, "No poo-poo jokesl"
Then they'll drag in the bandit for all to see,
Saying "Don't nobody have no sympathy . . .
HOT SOAPY WATER in the FIRST DEGREE!"
And the Bandit might say, "Why is everbody always pickin' on me?"
WELL DID YOU CAUSE THIS MISERY?
WELL DID YOU CAUSE THIS MISERY?
WELL DID YOU CAUSE THIS MISERY?
One girl shout: "Let the Bandit be!"
BANDIT ARE YOU GUILTY?
TELL ME, WHAT'S YOUR PLEA?
Another girl shout; "Let fhe friend go free!"
ARE YOU GUILTY?
BANDIT, DID YOU DO THESE DEEDS?
"he Bandit say, "It must be just what they all needs . . "
Silence is mocking, the dawn of a new day
Devil and Daughter, are both on their way
The Evil of her nature, collects in her eyes
With him there's no fear, of the dawn bringing light
Baptised with fire, to wild to be tamed
She's hot, evil and ready, to take any man
Let no one put asunder, the power or the pain
He is the master of hell, riding again
Devil and Daughter - pleasure and pain
Devil and Daughter - is this the end
A thousand times over, you'll hear on the wind
In the name of hell, these sinners never sinned
But Satan never listens, to the words that they send
Drenching the soil with blood, when will it end
Devil and Daughter
He's got the power she's got the pain
Devil and Daughter
She'll break any woman and take any man
Devil and Daughter
Hand in hand with the reper
Uh
Uh, yeah
Won't stop niggas
"Somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game"
Jigga! Feel me!
Pa-pause, told ya motherfuckers, told ya
"See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke"
Uh, Roc-A-Fella
Geyeah
We treat this rap shit just like, handling weight
What they want we give it to 'em, what they abandon we take
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake
Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake
When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state
Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
Let 'em test the product, give 'em a promo show
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
Then we drop a maxi single and charge 'em two for five
Ain't trying to, kill 'em at first just, building clientele
So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale
But when demand grows it's time to expand yo
You don't want no garbage papi, it's ten grand per blow, for sure
"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke"
"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke"
"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke"
Ge-ge-geyeah
I got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk
Got your whole block now, pumping my work
My CDs is like keys for you Willie's who
Like to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-twos
And my singles like gems, you know the treys
Get you high for a while, but the, high don't stay
You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks
'Cause when this shit flip, I'ma get on some other shit
Never pitching for a label, Jigga's the hook-up
You know my shit is fish-scale, y'all niggas is cook up
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Dakota
They know my shit stretch without the baking soda
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key
Priority's work wasn't right so I switched factories
Now I'm the new nigga, who figured I'd get the game locked
Now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, papa
"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke"
"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke"
"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke"
"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke"
Step right up, march, push
Crawl right up on your knees
Please, greed, feed (no time to hesitate)
I want a little bit
I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I want to watch it come down
Don't like the look of it
Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down
All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?
Shove it up inside, surprise, lies
Stains like the blood on your teeth
Bite, chew, suck away the tender parts
I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
Maybe afraid of it
Let's discredit it
Let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down
All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?
Don't you feel a whole lot better?
Don't you feel a whole lot better?
Don't you feel a whole lot better?
Don't you feel a whole lot better?
Don't you feel a whole lot better?

Moaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb
Can only cry but
Can not swim
Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot
The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away
Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick
If you got the money you can go to the top
As long as you can raise that
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy
You could have a taste
A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want
My small dog, he want what I got
Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
The little man follows his nose
Counts his fingers and his toes
He still got those

Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving

Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or

Lost Keys
Excuse me? Doctor? If you have a moment?
A moment? What's the question?
More of a situation, a gentleman in exam 3.
What's the problem?
That is the problem, we're not sure.
You got the chart?
Right here.
Not much there, is there?
No doctor, no obvious physical trauma. Vitals are stable.
Name?
No sir.
Did someone drop him off?
Maybe we could speak to them.
Let's get some background on this fellow.
No ID. Nothing
And he won't speak to anybody.
Well, let's say "Hello".
Good morning, I'm Dr. Watson.
Look, son, you're in a safe place.
We wanna help in whatever way we can.
But you need to talk to us.
We can't help you otherwise.
What's happened? Tell me everything.
Said you took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh, so quietly
They say
Shoulda took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame
Something cheap
For you
Everyone says "Hi"
Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing
To say
I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good
And it's not too hot
For you
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says
Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says "Hi"
If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do the old things
We can do all the bad things
If the food gets you leery
You can always phone
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do it
We could do it
Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
And the girl next door
And the guy upstairs
Everyone says "Hi"
And your mum and dad
Everyone says "Hi"
And your big fat dog
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
Hi hi hi hi
Going back again to see that girl
I left behind me when I went out
To see this great big world
I hope that she feels the same about me
As she did before I went out
To see this great big world
I know I love that girl
And I hope that she still wants me to be
Her one and only guy
Going back to see that girl I love
And I'm so happy I could cry
Going back to take her in my arms again
And tell her that I'm not
Gonna leave her anymore
I love her so much
I just can't wait until I touch
Her and I'm not gonna leave her anymore
I know I love that girl
And I hope that she still wants me to be
Her one and only guy
Going back to see that girl I love
And I'm so happy I could cry
I'm looking forward to that day
When she will love me in her way
All day long I sit and pray
Someday soon I'll hear her say
Looking forward to that day
When she will love me in her way
All day long I sit and pray
Someday soon I'll hear her say
You have been away so long
I missed you so much since you've gone
And now you are standing at my door
I love you so much
I just can't wait until I touch
You, dear, and now you are standing at my door
Please, let me take you in my arms
And squeeze you, baby, and don't mind
The tear that's in my eye
'Cause, darling, you've come back with me
I'm so happy I could cry
I'm so happy I could cry
I'm so happy I could cry
You're gone and now I'm all alone
I cry and wonder what went wrong
God knows I tried, you know I need you
You are my life, my only vice
They say, "Go on," I can be strong
My pride is gone, I'll never leave you
We've got love to share together
Don't let them keep us apart
Let's not let another minute go
Your friends all say we won't go on
They say your love was never strong
They say that I could never please you
Don't let them toss our love aside
Hey girl, don't break this heart of mine
How could you ever listen to them?
We've been used, abused, confused
But we can't let them get us down
Say you love me, say you need me now
Why don't we start out a new day
Start love a true way
We'll get along so well
We've heard enough talk
Let's try to walk hand in hand
Why don't we stop our hearts from hurting
Start our flames a-burning
We'll work it out somehow
Get something going
Start something going now
Hey, hey, yeah
We've been through so much together
Love has always been our guide
We can make it, our love will survive
Ah, why don't we start out a new day
Let's do it our way
Our love would be so strong
We're gonna make it
We've got to make it now
Why don't we start out a new day
Start love a true way
We'll get along so well
We've heard enough talk
Let's try to walk hand in hand
Why don't we start out a new day
Start love a true way
We'll get along so well
We've heard enough talk
Let's try to walk hand in hand
Di-di, di-di-di-di-di, yeah, oh
Fuck youuuuuuu!
I can't say what I want to,
even if I'm not serious.
I can't say what I want to,
even if I'm not serious.
Things like....
Fuck yourself, fuck Yourself,
you piece of shit, why don't you just go, kill yourself!
I said,
I can't say what I want to, even if I'm not serious.
I can't say what I want to, even if I'm just kiddiiiiingg!
People tell me what to say,
what to think, and what to play.
I said, people tell me what to say,
what to think, and what to play.
Things like.... Fuck yourself
fuck Yourself,
you piece of shit, why don't you just go kill yourself?
I said, I can't say what I want to, even if I'm not serious.
I can't say what I want to, even if, I'm just kiddiiiiingg.
Fuck yourself,
Fuck yourself,

why don't you go fuck yourseeeeeeeelf?
People tell me what to say,
what to think, and what to play.
I said, people tell me what to say,
what to think, and what to playyyy!
Just Kidding
Yeah, yeah
Everyone knows him as "old folks"
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird, and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so, mmm
Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Puts his napkin under, oh, his chin
And that yellow cob pipe
It's so mellow, it's right
You needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'd go fishing
Way down on Buzzard's Bay
But he'd only hook a perch or two
"A whale got away"
So, so we warmed up the steak, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, someday there'll be no more old folks
What a lonely old town this will be
Children's voices at play
Will be still for a day
The day they take old folks away
Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
The brightest flame burns quickest
But I must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time
He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other now the perk's are due
Another memo to screw
She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child without them spotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim
He's come to turn you in
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do, do
Didn't hear it from me
Hah, hah, hah, hah, yeah, yeah
What it is player?
(You player, it's all about you
How you gon' say that man)
If I had your hand I'd turn mine in
(Far as I'm concerned, if I had your hand, I cut mines off)
Hah man, you know man, I'm just dealing that hoe money
You know hoe money is slow money but it's sure money
(Check this out man, you run up on your bitches
This is what you tell 'em
Stick they hands in they panties, grab that knot
Stick they arm in a car window, drop it like it's hot)
Uh, I talk jewels and spit diamonds: all cherry
Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere
18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rapping them through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
'Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
Yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wine down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate, with this rich nigga rhetoric
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know
From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, Now
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Focus on the loc', I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi, from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
Yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick hard
Whoooh! (That's cashmere baby)
Nah, you know, that's just laid back man
(Man, shit, J to the A to the Y to the Z)
Cashmere baby
(Motherfucking pimp that's what he be)
Cashmere baby
(It don't get no hotter than that baby)
Sure you're right, sure you're right
(Them niggas know)
Check it out, check it out
Ghetto's Errol Flynn, hot like heroin
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your borough and
I gotta keep your tricks intact
'Cause I walk like a p-iy-imp, talk like a mack, man
The star player, the golden bar layer
The sweet Ms. Fine Thing puh-layah, sure you're right
I'm game tight, so why should it change tonight?
Go tell your peeps dog I'm lethal until it ain't right
I pimp hard on a trick: look
Fuck if your leg broke bitch, hop up on your good foot
"I, I don't have a whole lot of time.
Um, OK, I'm a former employee of Area 51.
I, I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago and, and...
I've kind of been running across the country.
Damn, I don't know where to start, they're,
they're gonna, um, they'll triangulate on this position really soon.
OK, um, um, OK,
what we're thinking of as, as aliens,
they're extradimensional beings,
that, an earlier precursor of the, um, space program they made contact with.
They are not what they claim to be.
Uh, they've infiltrated a, a lot of aspects of, of, of the military establishment,
particularly the Area 51.
The disasters that are coming, they, the military,
I'm sorry, the government knows about them.
And there's a lot of safe areas in this world that they could begin moving
the population to now. They are not!
They want those major population centers wiped out so that the few
that are left will be more easily controllable."
Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until I am dead
Rage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry I shall be
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
No
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand
Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame
And holds me down until it is through
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I sink into the sorrow, still I stand
And hate is a train
That hungers for the flesh's call
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell again
Yeah, cursed to drown in sorrow
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
You left me here with sorrow, still I stand
Oh, still I stand
It's all an open center
Opens up and lets the wind lift him away
It doesn't have to feel water
It's just a place that feels right with him
Kinda like the way you're breathing
I kinda like the way you keep looking away
Would you like to glide on
Slide a mile six inches at a time on Maynard's dick
There's a shyness found in reason
Apprehensive influence swallow away
You seem to feel abysmal take it
then you're careful grace for sure
Kinda like the way you're breathing
Kinda like the way you keep looking away
Would you like to climb on
Climb on my six inches and go down on Maynard's dick
Took you out in the back of the toolshed
Put it right on top of your forehead
Took you out in the back of the toolshed
Now you know what you're fuckin with... Maynard's dick!
I was drifting from day to day
Like a child that's lost his way
In a great big world
Then a miracle happened by
When you happened into my life
And said you love me
All around me the world was cold
Then you tenderly touched my soul
With your sunshine girl
And my future you gave it birth
And my living you gave it worth
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true,
Oh ho ho
When I'm feelin' my faith is gone
You're my reason for going on
Through another day
Cause the tender times that we share
Truly show me that you care about me
Whenever life makes you cry
Just remember I'm standing by
To lead the way
And together we'll never fall
Together we'll conquer all
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true
She waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course she never showed
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home through the snow
North along Riverside
She slips beneath the sheets
A husband's quiet devoted wife
But strangers, sad and nervous
By the dawn's early light
Love lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby, yellow lawn
Up on Riverside
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson yeah
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now
I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson, yeah

And she'll drive the big car
And talk herself insane
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(I'll bring you there)
Way back when millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her a dream-life
He'd take her back to street-life
Away from violent water
With its cormorants and leaves
Up on Riverside
She'll drive the big car
But he'll sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now
I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now
I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson, yeah
(I'll bring you there)
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
(I'll bring you there)
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
Yeah, got a little cold
So bear with me
Yeah, yeah

And my head is scratching 'cause that shit is backwards

We got to get together babe
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?
What the hell?
What is it you think you're going to find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within
Home is not a home, it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell
Reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in
The pressure upon you is so unreal
Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within
Struggle
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
What the hell?
What is it you think you're going to find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within

Stunned by JOE's command of its native tongue, a gleaming model
XQJ-37 nuclear powered Pan-Sexual Roto-Plooker named SY BORG
(previously thought to be the son of the lady who called the Police on cut
two, side I), spindles over to JOE and says..
Pick me...I'm clean...
I am also programmed for conversational English.
This stuns JOE, who stands there speechless for a moment. Smitten by
JOE's animal magnetism, SY continues...
May I have this dance?
And JOE, looking sharp in his housewife costume with the napkin on
his head and the yellow chiffon apron, responds boldly by repeating the
entreaty originally delivered in Deutsch in its conversational English form,
so that his intentions regarding the Appliance will be made perfectly clear...
I've got a better idea...
Fuck me, you ugly son of a bitch
You ugly son of a bitch
Fuck me, you ugly son of a bitch
Stick it out
Stick out yer hot curly weenie
Stick it out
Stick out yer hot curly weenie
Stick it out
Stick out yer hot curly weenie
Weenie.. .weenie, weenie, weenie!
Make it go fast

Make it go fast

Don't get no jizz upon that sofa, sofa
Don't get no jizz upon that sofa, sofa
Don't get no jizz upon that sofa, sofa
Don't get no jizz upon that sofa, sofa
Whereupon, in order to prove to JOE that he is no ordinary Appliance,
SY quotes a few lines of traditional American Love Poetry...
What s a girl like you
Doing in a place like this?
Do you come here often?
Wail a minute...
I've got it...
You're an Italian...
What?
You're Jewish?
Lore your nails..
Yon must be a Libra....
Your place or mine?
Your place or mine?
Your place or mine?
Your place or mine.
See the chrome
Feel the chrome
Touch the chrome

See the screaming
Hot black steaming
Iridescent naugahyde python screaming
Steam Roller!
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER. Joe and his date an going back
to the apartment to have a little party...
Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin
Open my eyes just to have them close again
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod
Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin
Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
As it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built
Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, I am, I am, I am
Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away
Away
If I were you
I wouldn't trust
A single word
I say
Think by now
You should know
Nothing's going
To change
Can I ask you something?
What did you expect?
So disappointed
With what you get
Do you ever want to
Just get out of here?
So disappointed
You disappear
Look at you
Superman
With all the world
To save
You think by now
You'd figure out
That nothing's going
To change
And I am part of the reason
Can I ask you something?
What did you expect?
So disappointed
With what you get
Do you ever want to
Just get out of here?
So disappointed
You disappear
She shines in a world full of ugliness
She matters when everything is meaningless
Fragile, she doesn't see her beauty
She tries to get away
Sometimes it's just that nothing seems worth saving
I can't watch her slip away
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
Hoping someone can see
If I could fix myself I'd
But it's too late for me
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
We'll find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide
I'll build a wall and we can keep them on the other side
...but they keep waiting
...and picking
...and picking
...and picking
...and picking
...and picking
...and picking
...and picking
...and picking
...and picking
It's something I have to do
(I won't let you fall apart)
I was there, too
(I won't let you fall apart)
Before everything else
(I won't let you fall apart)
I was like you
(I won't let you fall apart)
FADE
Underneath the skin and jewelry,
hidden in her words and eyes
is a wall that's cold and ugly
and she's scared as hell.
Trembling at the thought of feeling.
Wide awake and keeping distance.
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.
I am frightened too
I am frightened
Oh oh oh.
Trembling at the thought of feeling
Wide awake and keeping distance
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.
I am frightened too
I am frightened
Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul.
Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul
FADE
Underneath the skin and jewelry,
hidden in her words and eyes
is a wall that's cold and ugly
and she's scared as hell.
Trembling at the thought of feeling.
Wide awake and keeping distance.
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.
I am frightened too
I am frightened too
I am scared like you
I am frightened
Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.
The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.
After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.
The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.
The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.
Honey, I'm sorry that I had to go
But there's something about me that you didn't know
When I was young, I fathered a son
Now he's got himself in trouble
And now he's on the run
His mother and I were quite young at the time
But there's not much room for doubt
That the child was mine
I asked her folks for her hand
But they said there's just no way
No matter how I begged and pleaded
They sent their daughter away
I only know his name
But I was touched by what the paper said
They said he's on the run
With a price on his head
So I've got to find him
I feel it's my place
I've got to find my son
I've got no time to waste
I've got to find him
'Cause he's my son
If he had had a father there to guide his way
He wouldn't be on the run today
I never saw my son
I only knew his name
When he turned five years old
His photograph came
I've got this worn out picture
A name of a town
With no other trace left to be found
But I'm sure I'll find him
'Cause he is my son
'Cause a father's love remains
No matter what his child has done
So I've got to find him
I feel it's my place
I've got to find my son
I've got no time to waste
I've got to find him
'Cause he is my son
If he had had a father there to guide his way
He wouldn't be on the run today
Oh, oh, yeah
I'm really getting worried, people
I've got to find my son
Some friends of his told me they saw him
Running with a gun
So I've got to find him
I feel it's my place
I've got to find my son
I've got no time to waste
I've got to find him
Oh, 'cause he is my son
If he had had a father there to guide his way
He wouldn't be on the run today
Oh, I've got to find, oh, I've got to, ooh
(I feel it's my place) Feel it's my place
Oh, I've got to find my son
I've got no time to waste
I am the voice inside your head
(And I control you)
I am the lover in your bed
(And I control you)
I am the sex that you provide
(And I control you)
I am the hate you try to hide
(And I control you)
I take you where you want to go
I give you all you need to know
I drag you down, I use you up
Mr. Self Destruct
I speak religion's message clear
(And I control you)
I am denial, guilt, and fear
(And I control you)
I am the prayers of the naive
(And I control you)
I am the lie that you believe

You let me do this to you (I am an exit)
I am the needle in the vein
I am the high you can't sustain
I am the pusher, I'm a whore
I am the need in you for more
I am the bullet in the gun
(And I control you)
I am the truth from which you run
(And I control you)
I am the silencing machine
(And I control you)
I am the end of all your dreams
(And I control you)
I take you where you want to go

Mr. Self Destruct
I take you where you want to go
I give you all you need to know
I drag you down, I use you up
Mr. Self Destruct
I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end crippling our communication
I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication
(Cold, cold, cold)
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion between supposed lovers
Between supposed brothers
I know the pieces fit
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow sorrow
You acted funny
Trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high-class games of sorrow sorrow
You never do what you know you ought to
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ah, ah, ah
I tried to find her
'Cause I can't resist her
(I tried to find her)
I never knew just how much I missed her sorrow sorrow
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, oh, yeah
Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes
Shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky
And a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me
No fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh you pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh you pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way
For the homo superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The earth is a bitch we've finished our news
Homo sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh you pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh you pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way
For the homo superior
Mm oh, oh
Oh oh no, mm
You and me, having sex
After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, having sex, yeah
After an argument, that shit's the best
(Think about it while the streets you roam
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)
I storm in, she storm out
It's like The War of the Roses going on in my house
It's a little separation but I know how to fix the situation
Mami just suffering from love deprivation
So I gotta give her thug reparations
Put it in the life until love leg is shaking
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens
Then we laughing and we back friends
You don't have to fuss and fight
Why don't you just spend the night
Baby let's just kiss and hug
You know the words girl let's make up
So much love to be made
Instead of screaming, "Who's to blame?"
Girl I don't wanna let you go, I need you so
You and me, having sex
After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, having sex, yeah
After an argument, that shit's the best
(Think about it while the streets you roam
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)
Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little
'Cause I had the crisp tee on with the crease in the middle
Plus a fresh cut and the freezing icicles
On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
Said, "You never spend time with me, what's up with that?"
Translated it means (hit it harder from the back)
Yeah, she hid my car keys
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat
You don't have to fuss and fight
Why don't you just spend the night
Baby let's just kiss and hug
You know the words girl let's make up
So much love to be made
Instead of screaming, "Who's to blame?"
Girl I don't wanna let you go, I need you so
You and me, having sex
After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, having sex, yeah
After an argument, that shit's the best
I don't want baby I don't want to fight
I just wanna make it right (ooh yeah)
Put out problems to the side
Let's just make sweet love tonight (I don't want)
Baby I don't want to fight
I just wanna make it right (oh love)
Put our problems to the side
Let's just make sweet love tonight
Sex so intense, all that's on my mind
It ain't feel this good since the very first time
I'm pulling her close, she's pulling away
I'm trying to kiss her mouth but she keeps turning her face
Cute sex game like our very first date
We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait
But oh! I know just where your hot spot at
You can not deny that, so do not try that
I do not buy that
You and me, having sex
After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, having sex, yeah
After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, having sex
After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, having sex, yeah
After an argument, that shit's the best
Sorcerers of madness
Selling me their time
Child of god sitting in the sun
Giving peace of mind
Fictional seduction
On a black snow sky
Sadness kills the superman
Even fathers cry
Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself and see
My world and know that it is good
You know that I should
Superstitious century
Didn't time go slow
Separating sanity
Watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker
Spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans
In disquise
Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories and feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should
Watching eyes of celluloid
Tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor-replay
Give, give, give!
Laughter kissing love
Is showing me the way
Spiral city architect
I build, you pay
Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my earth and feel the warmth
And know that it is good
Can you hear, the people sing their song,
To tunes of glory, they move as one.
Refugees of liberation marching on,
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.
When you take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's
Left is humanity.
It's getting closer, change is bound to come.
There's someone out there, holding candles to the
Sun.
Then an answer, says that peace will come around,
Stand in line, take your time and be proud.
Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is
Humanity,
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you
And me.
Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love.
Refugees of liberation marching on,
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.
Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is
Humanity,
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you
And me.
Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love.
Hear them call you, dying for love, those who know
You, dying for love.
Brothers, sisters, dying for love, saints and sinners,
Dying for love,
Dying for love.
Into each life there comes a time
When you must pay your lovers' dues
Breakin' out in a cold sweat
Cause you've been rightfully accused
I'm not such a strong man
That love can't make me weak
You're walkin' out the door
And it's hurting me so deep, so deep
And I'm sorry
Sorry that I made you cry
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies
I'm sorry, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're
saying goodbye to me
Every young boy will grow up
To then become a man
Then the difference from wrong and right
He clearly understands
I'm not such a big man
That I can't break down in tears
Cause my whole body went into shock
When you told me you were out of here! Out of here!
And I'm sorry
Sorry that I made you cry
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies
I'm sorry, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're saying
goodbye to me, to me
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever made you cry
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever told you lies
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, so sorry
If you added up all the good times
And compared them with the bad
You'd realize that our love
Was the best you ever had
I'm not such a proud man
That I won't cop a plea
See me baby girl, I'm on my knees
Beggin please, baby please, baby please, oh yeah
I'm sorry, sorry that I made you cry
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies
I'm sorry, I'm sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're
saying goodbye to me, me baby, me baby, me baby
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever told you lies
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever made you cry
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry
We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The Moon in silver dreams
Falls down in beams
Light of the night
The Earth a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always
While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks
Dawn from night
And so we pass on by
The crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone, growing older
And so bitter
She gave them life
She gave them all
They drained her very soul dry
Dry, dry
Hey hey hey, bitter girl
We're out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's easy
Don't be so bitter
Oh oh oh, crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
In return
Left high and dry, oh
And as the sun rise stream
Flickers on
She finds lavender
To hide the beckoning of hatred
Oh, what rise, baby skin
Throws back her head to scream her sides
The woodland shades its eyes
To such a strange event
Hey hey hey, bitter girl
We're not just sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's tragic
You seem to lose
Oh oh oh, crazy girl
Don't throw your heart to the prowling moon
Don't wait too long for the prowling moon
Why do you stay here for so long
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun
Uh-huh
That's right
It was all good just a week ago
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry
And then my motherfucking niggas started snitching
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
Bitch!
Growing up in the hood, just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talking reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, "Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?"
He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home."
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
Them crackers up there bleaching your dome, you're reaching
I said, "The world don't stop, I got to keep keep on."
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe, 'cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
It's on
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar, now you crying for bail
Seventeen and I'm holding on to around a mill'
I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinking I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezing on them corners, still holding my crack
Looking up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to letting the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said, "I'm never going back"
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago
The lawyer I retained you said you leaking some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling
I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
The same game that make you math could make you die
(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up, like, "This is my dad?"
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago
Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitching
We was one step away from taking this crack money
And recycling it through the ghettos
And building back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitching on each other
I got partners doing 15-20
Wouldn'ta been doing shit
If you didn't snitch, bitch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
We'd sure go a lot whole further
Believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house mane
You know I got it
Got it going on
We got the money
Ain't got nothing to do with crime baby
But I'm recognizing
You rat bastard!
Purest feeling
Purest feeling
Well I think I'm going to push it as far as it will go
Give in to desire
Only you will know
So tell me all your secrets
I'll stick it in your head
I wish I could remember everything she said
Purest feeling
Purest feeling
Purest feeling
Purest feeling
Well she can be my savior with everything she does
Or some kind of punishment for people just like us
I don't really believe she understands what's happening to me
The sooner that she gets it the better it will be
Purest feeling
Purest feeling
Purest feeling
Purest feeling
Purest feeling
I have got it figured out (I should have known all along)
I can't live without her
Purest feeling
I have got it figured out
Purest feeling
Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away
Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it,
Oh yes, my love has gone astray
But I'll blame it on the sun,
The sun that didn't shine,
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees
I'll blame it on the time that never was enough,
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea,
But, my heart blames it on me
Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?
Wish I could tell you,
What I am feeling,
But, words won't come for me to speak
But I'll blame it on the sun,
That didn't fill the sky,
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees
I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon,
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be,
But, my heart blames it on me
...Yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh,
Your heart blames it on you this time
Whooo! Whooo!

Bags by Chanel or Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a 10 chances you're with him
If you're a 5 you know you riding with them
Sick with the pen, nigga no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription you can prescribe to subside his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like Rain Man, twitching
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens
Can dead his sickness, no Ouija board
You can't see me, dog; nigga, ya CB4

Do you want me to do it?
Don't come closer, cos it ain't safe here,
Just turn around now and walk away.
I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here,
Sometimes I wonder, what goes on there,
Behind those eyes.
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands,
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful,
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your
Hands.
From a cross of thorns.
Tongues of fire always talking, wasted words that
Ring in my ears.
We're still waiting, losing patience. Will all the lies
Of, 400 years.
I've got to tell you, there are no rules here,
Sometimes I wonder,
What goes on there, behind those eyes.
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands,
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful,
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your
Hands.
From a cross of thorns.
We gave you yesterdays, and now you want to-day,
Oh, from the hands of death we take our daily bread,
Now all we do is choke, and the words that you once
Spoke, fade away.
Look at what you've done, oh, it's a cross of thorns.
Take away, this cross of thorns, look at what you've
Done,
It's a cross of thorns, cross of thorns.
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,
You've got blood on your hands, from a cross of
Thorns.
Fountain... of... love!
One... two...
It was September, the leaves were gold
That's when our hearts knew that story untold
We were young lovers
(We were young lovers)
Strolling near
The fountain of love
Fountain of love
Fountain of love
(Fountain of love)
Fountain of love
Do you remember, I held you so near
Our love's glowing ember so precious and dear
We were young lovers
(Lovers)
Strolling near
The fountain of love
Fountain of love
Fountain of love
(Fountain of love)
Fountain of love
We made a wish
(Lo-o-o-o-ove)
And threw in a coin
And since that day
(Lo-o-ove)
Our hearts have been joined
So all you young lovers
(Lo-o-o-o-ove)
Wherever you are
The fountain of love is not very far
We'll go on dreaming of that golden day
And remember the fountain is not far away
We were young lovers
(Lo-o-o-overs)
Strolling near
The fountain of love
Fountain of love
Fountain of love
Fountain of love
(Lo-o-ove)
We made a wish and threw in a coin
(Lo-o-ove)
And since that day, our hearts have been joined
(Lo-o-ove)
So all you young lovers wherever you are
The fountain of love is not very far
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (wee-oo)
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (wee-oo)
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (wee-oo)
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (wee-oo)
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (wee-oo)
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (wee-oo)
Fountain of love...
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
A year ago today
Was when you went away
But now you come back knockin' on my door
And you say you're back to stay,
But I say...
Go cry
On somebody else's shoulder
I'm somewhat wiser now
And one whole year older
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you
Anymore
You cheated me baby,
And told some dirty lies about me
Fooled around with all those other guys
That's why I had to set you free
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you
Anymore
A year ago today
You went away
And now you come back crying
Crying, crying: please, let me in
But I don't need you
No I don't love you anymore
So go lean on...go cry on
Somebody else's door
Go cry
On somebody else's shoulder
I'm somewhat wiser now
And one whole year older
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you
Anymore (Oh, my darling!)
Go ahead and cry
Go ahead and let the tears fall outa your eye
Let 'em fall on your dress
Who cares if it makes a mess?
I gave you my high school ring
At the root beer stand
We had a teen-age love baby
I thought it was sharp
It was really so grand...but
You cheated me baby
And told some dirty lies about me
Fooled around with all those other guys
That's why I had to get my khakis pressed
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you
Anymore
Baby, I love you so much, darling
Why don't you dig me?
I dig you
But you don't dig me
I don't understand what it is
I had my car re-upholstered
I got my hair processed
I got a nice pompadour job on it
I bought a new pair of shoes
I got some new khakis and I met you
And we went out to get a Coca-Cola...
Love of my life
Thank you!
Love of my life
Love of my life, I love you so
Love of my life, don't ever go
I love you only
Love, love of my life
(Love of my life)
Stars in the sky
They never lie
Tell me you need me
Don't say goodbye
(Don't say it)
I love you only
Love,
(Love)
Love of my life
Stars in the sky
They never lie
Tell me you need me
Don't say goodbye
I love you darling
I love you only
Don't ever leave me
Don't make me lonely
Love of my life
I love you so
(I love, I love, I love you so)
Love of my life
Don't ever go
I love you only
Love, love of my life
Love of my life
Love of my life
Love of my life
Love of my life
Love of my...
What was it like to see,
The face of your own stability,
Suddenly look away,
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone.
Eleven is when we waved good-bye.
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him,
By coming home.
Moving me with a sound.
Opening me within a gesture.
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
Eleven.
He was too scarred to realize,
You were the voice that's been calling me back home.
Under a dead Ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light and wondering,
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping lost and numb
I'm so glad that I have found you.
I am wide awake and heading,
Home.
I wish that I could see you,
Turn and run to play.
Dreams are fading,
Carry my ancient soul.
Carry me into the light.
Aim your body heavenly,
Enduring a memory.
I'll come to your light,
Hold your light.
Hold your light where I can see it,
Hold it,
High.
Hold your light,
Eleven, lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory,
I'll move,
To heal,
As soon as pain allows so we can,
Reunite,
And both move on together.
Hold,
Your light,
Eleven lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory 'til
One
And one are one,
Eleven.
So glow,
Child,
Glow.
I'm heading back home...
Accept the fact that you're second rate life is easy for you
It's all served up on a gold plated plate
And we don't even have to talk to you
Your face is normal that's the way you're bred
And that's the way you're going to stay
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel
But someone else's finger's on the control panel
What you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Don't you wanna be brother - Zero the hero
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a hero
You sit there watch it all burn down
It's easy and breezy for you
You play your life to a different sound
No edge no edge you got no knife have you
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there
Where the heroes sit by the river
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver
You stand there captain we all look
You really are mediocre
You are the champion in the Acme form book
But I think you're just a joker
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing
It's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing
You had all of them on your side
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You believed in all your lies
Didn't you? Didn't you?
The ruiner's got a lot to prove
He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
The ruiner's your only friend
Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
The raping of the innocent
You know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
Now the only pure thing left
In my fucking world is wearing your disease
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd it get so hard?
How'd it get so long?
You had to give them all a sign
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine
Didn't you? Didn't you?
The ruiner's a collector
He's an infector serving his shit to his flies
Maybe there will come a day
When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took
To a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up
Much more than you'll ever know
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd it get so long?
And what you gave to me
My perfect ring of scars
You know I can see
What you really are
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop
When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice
Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave
Then we can live in our new land
'Til the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
'Til that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream
My love is gone with yesterday, my love is gone
with yesterday
We had a love for all seasons
At least that's how it used to be
There was no time, space, or reason
More special to us than we
My love continued to flourish
As a flower blooms in spring
Then you tried to play love for silly
But the loser is the fool who doesn't play
love by the rules
If she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Cause I may not be around to do the things
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way
Cause the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday, my love is gone
with yesterday
There was a time when forever
Was common-place for me and you
Laughing, loving, sharing, caring
Seemed to be made just for us two
But I kept on building the dream world
That I thought was you and I
Sorry, I'm sadly mistaken
Cause our castle in the sky
Has turned into a mere goodbye
Well if she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Cause I may not be around to do the things
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way
Cause the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday
My love is gone away with yesterday, my love is gone
with yesterday
The epidemic from a crystal lie
Puts you in super over drive
The methademic that is so hard to hide
Insanely staring with wide eyes
Hellucinating in a chemical Hell
Ain't my idea of having fun
Synthetic overload you're under its spell
Your super nightmare's just begun
You try to stop, but it controls you
Your love affair with it won't last
You're on a suicidal ride of self-destruction
And in the end you're gonna crash
You live too fast
You live too fast
You look just like a dead man alive
Losing the fight for survival
You sit and wait at Hell's fiery gate
Waiting the Devil's arrival
Ha-Ha-Ha
You live so fast you need more methademic crystal
You never sleep you just keep goin
Just push the trigger on your hypodermic pistol
Each time you're dying without knowing
You live too fast
You live too fast
What's the point it's killing you without you even knowing
I can tell you've sold your soul and hell is where you're going
Ha-ha-ha I'll see you there
Hello Jesus

Um...um I need you Jesus
Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?
All the wants you waste
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
King Nothing?
Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?
All the wants you waste
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
Nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to never-never land
Lord she's handsome as she flows across the floor
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more
She's got the look of freedom, and it makes you think she's wild
But I can see right through it all, it's the way to have a child
Oh, walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Walk away, walk on
She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all
Like a star in the midnight sky, burns before it falls
I've never been lonely, and I can't imagine why
Maybe she could be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die
Can't see her fire
But I can feel her heat, all right!
It's rising higher
I'm walking the wire
Walk on by!
Oh! Walk away!
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Oh, walk on by, walk away!
Walk on!
You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher
But don't be fooled! Just turn your head and walk away!
What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker
You a punk, I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatching, jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or something
You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see 'em, try to be 'em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder
Locked rap for three summers, poker faces with the aces under
Phase one of the takeover, the break's over
Shit knocking, almost a crime, get Cochran
Banging to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They wanna see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros
We celebrate this, while you sitting back screaming you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spitting sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just giving face lifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Who start shit? My style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you wanna see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in Hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazing in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm Resident Evil, moving like
Millionaire that flow like water, rap niggas running
I ought to applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the MAC at ya, niggas caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't fuck with it
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets, TECs, honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was looking you found us
Moving with speed, tried to play Superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaohs of Egypt
Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it
Keeping my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16s
Bulging out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holding, share these shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it
Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screwface in forty-two ways
Aim better than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire
"Show Me The Money" like Clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zoning
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foaming
White sheets got ya wrapped like a Roman
Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
Niggas is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seeking, grill-hunting, still fronting?
Keep squeezing, fuck it, I leave the whole street wheezing
No motherfuckers hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got 'em scared to drop like soap in jail
Geah, there you have it
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours
Roc-A-Fella family
Eye on the TV
'Cause tragedy thrills me.
Whatever flavour
It happens to be like:
"Killed by the husband",
"Drowned by the ocean",
"Shot by his own son",
"She used a poison in his tea",
"And kissed him goodbye".
That's my kind of story.
It's no fun 'til someone dies.
Don't look at me like
I am a monster.
Frown out your one face
But with the other.
Stare like a junkie
Into the TV.
Stare like a zombie
While the mother
Holds her child,
Watches him die
Hands to the sky,
Crying, "Why, oh, why?"
'Cause I need to watch things die from a distance.
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies.
You all need it too.
Don't lie.
Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing.
Neither the brave nor bold
Will write us the story, so,
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing.
I need to watch things die from a good safe distance.
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies.
You all feel the same.
So, why can't we just admit it?
Blood like rain come down.
Drum on grave and ground.
Part vampire, part warrior.
Carnivore and voyeur.
Stare at the transmittal.
Sing to the death rattle.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie.
Credulous at best, your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of men.
Pull your head on out your hippie haze and give a listen.
Shouldn't have to say it all again.
The universe is hostile, so impersonal.
Devour to survive.
So it is. So it's always been.
We all feed on tragedy.
It's like blood to a vampire.
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies.
Much better you than I.
Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you
Falling.
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all
Tonight.
When the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand
That holds the knife,
And the knife that cuts the cable, kills the spark that
Feeds the life.
No grave could be deep enough, down to hell if we
Were able,
The veil of life was pushed aside, by the hand that
Rocks the cradle.
The oath you take is sacred, to save not steel a life,
Like the passing of the sweetest soul, that looked
Through human eyes.
No grave could be deep enough, down to hell if we
Were able,
The veil of life was pushed aside, by the hand that
Rocks the cradle.
Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you
Falling.
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all
Tonight.
No grave could be deep enough, down to hell if we
Were able,
The veil of life was pushed aside, by the hand that
Rocks the cradle.
It's the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand that
Steels the life.
Concentration Moon

Over the camp in the valley
(Concentration Moon)
(OH WHAT A)
Concentration Moon
(I wish I was back in the alley)
Wish I was back in the alley
With all of my friends,
Still running free:
(Running free!)
Hair growing out
Every hole in me
(That's right, you heard right:
Hair growing out
Every hole in me!)
AMERICAN WAY
How did it start?
Thousands of creeps
Killed in the park
AMERICAN WAY
Try and explain
Scab of a nation
Driven insane
Don't cry
Gotta go bye bye
SUDDENLY: DIE DIE
COP KILL A CREEP! pow pow pow
And speaking of creeps, here they are, ladies and gentlemen . . .
Used to be a bunch of assholes that lived in this part of the building here, but we systematically removed them like you would any kind of termite or roach
Someone told me once
That there's a right and wrong
Punishment was cure for those
Who dare to cross the line
But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you
And maybe it takes longer to catch a total asshole
I'm tired of waiting
Someone told me once
That there's a right and wrong
Punishment was cure for those
Who dare to cross the line
But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you
And maybe it's just bullshit
I should play God
And shoot you myself
Tired of waiting
Consequences dictate
Our course of action
And it doesn't matter what's right
It's only wrong if you get caught
If consequences dictate
My course of action
I should, I should play God
And just shoot you myself
Tired of waiting
Die now
Shoot it
Kick it
Fuck it
Shoot you in your fucking head
They knock on your door
You laugh in their face
They tell you it's time to pray
They give you a book
And tell you to read
And point to the Judgment Day
People say they live dangerously
Walking places they should not be
But they will walk their lives
With a never ending light
They will walk their lives
'til they shine the light
Of truth into your life
They sit on a stump
You run from their sight
To not hear the holy word
They sing and they chant
They preach and they speak
In tongues you have never heard
But people say they live dangerously
Walking places they should not be
But they will walk their lives
With a never ending light
They will walk their lives
'til they shine the light
Of truth into your life
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
Walk on ...
On corners of streets
And airports of tents
They reach out for you to come in
They have no defense
Except inner sense
And knowing the Almighty Friend
People say they live dangerously
Walking places they should not be
But they will walk their lives
With a never ending light
They will walk their lives
'til they shine the light
Of truth into your life : truth into your life
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
Come on and shine that light through the day through the night
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
Even though when they knock on your door
You laugh in their face
You run from their sight
Not to hear the holy word
They have no defense
Except inner sense
Haven't you

I got a strict strip, flip 'caine, get it in shifts
Bitch, you can't get at me, shit I get at you
Only in the physical, I tell you like Mystikal
"Shake that ass (yeah), watch yourself
(Yeah) show me what you working with but wash yourself"
Fuck a dirty bitch (yeah), man, I roll with a sturdy click
That'll murder shit, empty clips, you never heard a spit
Slide a bitch what? Slide a bitch shit
Slide a bitch dick, then I slide out a bitch shit
Ain't no time to stick around and play step pops
Shit I'm trying to get down, cop and upset blocks
Low price, quick flip, 2-8-K quick
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script
We cop, we flip, we re-up; get back on our shift
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script
We cop, we flip, we re-up; get back on our shift
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script
Y'all get knocked, y'all turn bitch
We get knocked, we never snitch, c'mon
Some people ask me why always on the bright side
When there's so much going on down the other side
It's like I live in a bubble with no trouble
And problems don't exist
I chuckle and tell them that ain't the case at all
It goes way back to the time when I was very small
Not in mind but size and age my papa use to say
You can always look at the negative
But you should always live in the positive
So I try everyday to live that way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some people live in what was and what they could have been
As opposed to living in a what is and how much they can
And be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way
The attitude is "that I can't do nothing 'bout"
And very happy with just breathing in and out
The ones that when you say "lets go make a difference"
They'll say "naw that's OK"
So I don't waste time on the trip side
'Cause I do know the real on the flipside
And I'm crystal clear everyday that's why I say, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I see the morning
And the sun is smiling down upon me
I joy in the blessing
That still the ground is not above me
And for the people
That I can truly say do love me, I feel
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be
Positivity, 'cause this day did not have to be
Some ask me why I'm such an optimist
When it's more fashionable be a pessimist
From what's in seventy-five percent of what we read, hear and view
Well I use to have a friend named Minnie Riperton
Who use to always say when she was living
"Like fine wine I like seeing the glass of life as half full than half empty"
I'm saying sometimes life can't be rough
But never to the point of me saying I've had enough
Long as my heart beats I ain't giving up
That's why I say everyday
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When people ask me as an African American
What do I see for tomorrow in the human plan?
Is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?
I say unity is only as big as our vision
And if its narrow, try to expand beyond the horizon
But true leaders must guide us through the ills of society
That stands in our way
So if the road is to harmony, be with the call
But if its about discord, don't take the ride at all
'Cause the world vision I see is the one-we for everybody
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I see the morning
And the sun is smiling down upon me
Just joy in the blessing
That still the ground is not above me
And for the people
That you can truly say do love you, do feel
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be
Positivity, and that's the energy the world needs
Positivity, 'cause that's what life means to me
Positivity, 'cause this day did not have to be
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be
Positivity, 'cause that's the energy the world needs
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be
Positivity, and this day did not have to be
Positivity, 'cause that's what life means to me
Positivity, and that's the energy the world needs
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be
Positivity, and that's the energy the world needs
Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
I am the chill that's in the air.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.
Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future, what is to be.
As the rivers flow into the sea.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.
Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
Steep is the mountain which we climb.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.
(I've been looking, I've been looking)
(I've been looking, I've been looking)
I've been looking
For a woman
To save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with a feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
A woman with a feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER...Joe has just worked himself into
an imaginary frenzy during the fade-out of his imaginary song...
He begins to feel depressed now. He knows the end is near. He has realized
at last that imaginary guitar notes and imaginary vocals exist only in the mind
of The Imaginer ...and ... ultimately, who gives a fuck anyway... Who gives a fuck
anyway? So he goes back to his ugly little room and quietly dreams his last
maginary guitar solo...
Put the screws to you, yeah, my way
Yeah, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day
Got some hell to pay, I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movement, pulls you under
Bite the bullet, well hard
Yeah, but I die harder, so go too far
Too far
Friction, fusion, retribution
Put the screws to you, my way
Hey, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day
Friction, fusion, retribution
Talk to two by four
Friction, fusion, retribution

Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Diame, Diame (peace and more peace)
Lock all the doors, kill the lights.
No one's coming home tonight.
The sun beats down and don't you know?
All our lives are growing cold, oh...
They bring news that must get through.
To build a dream for me and you, oh.
Locked in a place where no one goes.
They ask no quarter
They have no quarter.
Lock the door, kill the light
No one's coming home tonight
It's getting colder
Locked in a place where no one goes.
Lock the door, kill the light
No one's coming home tonight
They bring news that must get through.
Dying peace in me and you
Locked in a place where no one goes.
We have no quarter
We have no quarter
We ask no quarter
I've been informed that when the guy comes out that beats the gong we have to stop playing, because the subways around here shut down early. We'd like to thank you very much for coming to our concert and say goodnight. Nighty night, thank you.
Thank you!
What's coming through is alive.
What's holding up is a mirror.
But what's singing songs is a snake it is
Looking to turn my piss to wine.
They're both totally void of hate,
And killing me just the same.
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.
And I feel this coming over like a storm again.
Considerately.
Venomous voice, tempts me,
Drains me, bleeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty.
Drags me down like some sweet gravity.
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.
And I feel this coming over like a storm again now
I am too connected to you to
Slip away, fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
Considerately killing me.
Without the skin here
Beneath the storm,
Under these tears now
The walls came down.
As the snake is drowned
As I look in his eyes,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times.
I could have cried then.
I should have cried then.
And as the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
And will die.
It's all right.
I don't mind.
I am too connected to you to
Slip away, fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
And considerately killing me.
A lonesome fear
A hungry face
A barren pain
A dream unchased
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
A prayer is heard
By one so small
Let love be in the
Hearts of all
Oh I can't wait until there's sunshine in their eyes
You and I may never see them cry
Or wonder why the world's so cold
You feel that they're too young
To take a look around
But in their faces I can see the trouble all around
Today we must turn into lies
The truth already in their minds
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
He can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sunshine
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
Sunshine in our eyes
Oh my momma's worried cause she feels the world is ending
She believes that everything is coming to an end
Papa's stayin real careful cause his brother Sam was robbed
Trying to buy just a loaf of bread for baby John
See how the world escaped
All the streets turin bare
Most of the news is bad
Crime just feeds in the air
Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening
Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening
Cost of livin's up, but the pay is low and down
Hate to see the babies starve cause momma cant be found
Sister lives alone, bolts and chains the door at night
Never ever walks an alley or a shorter way
See how the world escaped
All the streets turin bare
Most of the news is bad
Crime just feeds in the air
Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening
Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening
Father Bills gone fighting in a place where he's a stranger
But could men die a stranger in every war
We all hide in shame bolding pointing to another
When the blame we know for sure is right in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves
Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening
Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening
la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la

I'm sweating,
and breathing
and staring and thinking
and sinking
deeper.
It's almost like I'm swimming.
The sun is burning hot again
on the hunter
and the fisherman,
but it makes me dizzy.
Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
into a dream within a dream.
Must be the way you whisper.
The sun is setting cool again.
I'm the thinker
and the fisherman
and I'm trying to remember when
but it makes me dizzy.
and I'm sweating,
and breathing,
and staring and thinking
and sinking deeper
and it's almost like I'm swimming.
Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
into a dream within a dream.
It's the way you whisper.
Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
into a dream within a dream.
drags me under
takes me home
Listen to him go!
Wait a minute; we gotta get somethin' real happenin' here
He's in there spendin' thousands of dollars 'n' shit...
We should make this worthwhile
We should
We should get into something REAL
Ho ho LEATHER!
No, man, he's not interested in Leather... shit
That shit's been fuckin' rubbed in the ground Hmmmm
Christ, that's goin' on two tours old now...
We gotta come up with some new shit ...
I am the crazy man
Who lives inside your head
But I think I'm breaking through the wall
You are the innocent
Convicted of the crime
No one was ever there
To catch you when you fall
I see the diamonds
But you only see the rock
I need to run
But you only crawl
It's time to open up
All the doors that you keep locked
Nobody gives without a take
Let's take it all
You've been twisted into pieces
By the hands of your emotions
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father
One more crucifixion
One more cross to bear
You're a hole in a photograph
Go on - lose it in the city
The city can feel no shame
See the world with electric eye
They call it mystery
But any fool could see
You thought he walked on the water
And if the pain was gone
And you were free to run away
And get out
Would you get out of there
Or do you really care
It's not safe or easy
And maybe when you're gone
You just won't belong at all
You're the only witness
To the murder of an angel
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father
It's just another crucifixion
One more cross to bear
Go on lose it in the city
Take a look at the world
You've got electric eyes
This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart
Climbed up real high, now fall down real far
No need for me to stay
The last thing left, I just threw it away
I put my faith in god and my trust in you
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
I'm the one without a soul
I'm the one with this big fucking hole
No new tale to tell
Twenty-six years, on my way to hell
Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad-luck, fist fuck
Don't think you're having all the fun
You know me, I hate everyone
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
This world full of you
This world full of you
This world full
I am all alone this time around
Sometimes on the side I hear a sound
Places parallel I know it's you
Feel the little pieces bleeding through
And on (And on)
This goes on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
This goes on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on
Now that I've decided not to stay
I can feel me start to fade away
Everything is back where it belongs
I will be beside you before long
And on (And on)
This goes on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
This goes on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)

Ooo we will never die
Ooo beside you in time
Ooo we will never die
Ooo beside you in time
This is not America, sha la la la la
A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die (This is not a miracle)
For this is not America
Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long (This is not America)
For this is not the miracle
There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
Sha la la la la
This is not America, no
This is not, sha la la la la
Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground
(This could be the biggest sky)
So bloody red, tomorrow's clouds
A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die (This could be a miracle)
For this is not America
There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
Sha la la la la
This is not America, no
This is not, sha la la la
This is not America, no
This is not
This is not America, no
This is not, sha la la la
Johnny is a man and he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you
When you ask him how the kids are
He'll get home around seven
'Cause the Chevy's real old
And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
And the food is on the table but the food is cold
(Don't hit her)
Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?
Well, Johnny is a man and he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
It shows through
It shows through
It shows through
If i'm caught at a dance party without my dancing shoes
And everybody dances on my bare feet
Shame on me
If i'm minding my business just doing the right thing
And you try to front me off in the street
Shame on you
If a family's waiting for that special blessing to
Come their way
But they ain't trying to get on their knees and pray
Shame on them
And if we live in a time where every nation's fighting
Around the world
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way
Shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss
If i gotta get up early in the morning for a job
Interview
And i forget to set the stupid alarm
Shame on me
If my children are playing outside like little children do
And you come around there trying to bring them some harm
Shame on you
Should i be driving thru a klantown, find a restaurant
To get me some food
And someone says "hey boy, we don't serve your kind"
Shame on them
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your
Power to vote
Knowing some would like to turn back the hands of time
Shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss
If I'm hooked on a habit knowing damn well it could
Cost me my life
Yet i keep doing what i should do without
Shame on me
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half
Just gives you abuse
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out
Shame on you
If we're jamming the music and somebody's got the
Audacity
To say that they can jam it better than us
Shame on them
And should there be just a handful that believe that
We are totally free
And there's no need to fight for equality
Shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss
What the fuss
What the fuss
What the fuss
What the fuss
Get up, get up now
Free yourself from yourself
Locked up inside you
Like the calm beneath castles
A cavern of treasures that
No one has been to
Let's go digging
Let's go digging
Bring it out and take it back in
You won't do what you'd like to do
Lay back and let me show you another way
Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away
Take it all
Take it all in
All the way in
All the way in
Let it go
Let it go in
You won't feel what you'd like to feel
Lay back and let me show you another way
Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away
Knock me down
I'll just come back running
Knock you down
It won't be long now
All the way in
All the way in
All the way
All the way
Way in!
Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away
Take it up, take it up higher
4 degrees now, 4 degrees warmer
Give in now
Give in now
Let me in!
You'll like this in
This brings us out
You'll like this
It brings us closer than
Dying and cancer and crying
Let's take it, take it...
Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it
Just like that
Just like that
Just like...
Dear PFIQ,
Since you printed my question and photo in issue number 29, PFIQ, I have received many letters.
I'm glad I'm retired so I have plenty of time to answer all.
I finally got rid of the smell
Of the deep scrotum piercings
By putting a 5/32-inches barbell and a 5/16-inches ring.
Now, air can get through.
(
Can you stand like that?
Maybe I should read the text one whole, because . . . again . . . oh . . .
Just . . . just say "now, air can get through")
Now, air can get through.
Don't ever quit putting out PFIQ, as it is most enjoy-able.
I have them all
And go over them many times.
You never heard anymore of Carl... Carol, issue n... number 14, I believe?
Keep up the great work. I don't know what to pierce next.
P.S. Do you use 1-percent xylocaine for deep cockhead piercings?
Piercing the head of the cock must be painful.
(OOHH!)
I had the head tattooed and it hurt like hell!
But I didn't want the artist to stop.
Choices always were a problem for you
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
What you need is someone strong to use you
Like me
Like me
Like me
Like me
If you want to get your soul to Heaven
Trust in me now, don't you judge or question
You are broken now, but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you
My God's will
Becomes me
When he speaks
He speaks through me
He has needs
Like I do
We both want
To rape you
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
If you want to get your soul to Heaven
Trust in me, now don't you judge or question
You are broken now, but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you
My God's will
Becomes me
When he speaks
He speaks through me
He has needs
Like I do
We both want
To rape you
Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street
Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meal - from garbage cans
Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink - drunk to all demands
Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the streets
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land
Village Ghetto Land
Midnight, something don't feel right
It's been too much, too far away from home
Hard life, living the hard life
I can't resist, I'm falling
To the danger zone
All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone
Red light, don't stop for no red light
You know I'm always trouble on my own
Lonely, ever so lonely
I've got too much time
I'm heading for the danger zone
All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone
I'm eager, eager to please
I can't stand no more
It's got me on my knees
Ain't gonna feel no hurt
Ain't gonna feel no pain
I got nothin' left to lose
I ain't got no shame
Don't try to stop me
Just leave me on my own
I'm gonna live or die
In the danger zone
I'm living in the danger zone
In the danger zone
Hard life, I'm living the hard life
I'm gonna take a chance
In the danger zone
Lonely, ever so lonely
I'm gonna live or die
In the danger zone
Midnight, can't wait until midnight
Help me I'm falling to the danger zone
There is nowhere else I can run to
She is wretched but she comforts me
After everyone goes home
She's always there for me
And when the sun goes hellbound
And the moon does resurrect the night
I'll hide within her
Not much good has come out the light
After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight down
A lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company
Tragic, heartless and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as she
And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within
I become two
We become one
Unbridled... unequaled... unholy... undone
The path is cut deep
The path is worn well
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of Hell
The warmth of Hell
Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Yourself
Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Waste my hate on you
Hate
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?
Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
Dead gone now
Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Waste my hate on you
Go
I've heard all I need to know
Your voice in fucking echo stereo
Well this particular scenario
Looks like another all time low
Why did you go and let them in
See this is where the fun begins
You barely even pierced the skin
Just wait 'til you see what is coming
Get down on the floor
Shut the goddamn door
Been down this road before
We're coming back for more
So give me just a little, baby
Just something to get by
This is gonna last forever, baby
We'll get the other side
And we will live forever, baby
And stretch across the sky
I'll follow right behind you, baby
We are never gonna die
Hey
Everything is not okay
We lost too much along the way
The passengers arrived today
It looks as though they're here to stay
This paranoia turns to fear
Just who was whispering in your ear?
Pretending, but I know you hear
Just how'd we fucking end up here?
So give me just a little, baby
(So give me just a little, baby)
Just something to get by
(Just something to get by)
This is gonna last forever, baby
(This is gonna last forever, baby)
We'll get the other side
And we will live forever, baby
(And we will live forever, baby!)
And stretch across the sky
(And stretch across the sky)
I'll follow right behind you, baby
(I'll follow right behind you, baby!)
We are never gonna die
We're never gonna die
How did we get so high?
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Something has to change.
Un-deniable dilemma.
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear.
Constant over-stimulation numbs me
But I would not want you
Any other way.
Just not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.
Finger deep within the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Relax, turn around and take my hand.
I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure.
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way.
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
'Til you will not want me any other way.
But it's not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.
Knuckle deep inside the borderline.
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.
Relax. Slip away.
(Chupa minha pica pichu)
(Chupa minha pica pinto)
(Chupa minha pica pinto)
(Relax, relax, relax, relax)
There's something kinda sad about
The way that things have come to be.
Desensitized to everything.
What became of subtlety?
Now how can this mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?
I'll keep digging
'Til I feel something.
Elbow deep inside the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Shoulder deep within the borderline.
Relax. Turn around and take my hand.
Oh it's night again
And the dark just killed the sun
If the light must end
You've got time to run away
There's a door to dreams
And it always lets you in
But with a silent scream
All the nightmares must begin
Still you chase what you can't see
Like death and pain and sin
And the Shadow of The Wind
The Shadow of The Wind
You'll remember me
I could make you disappear
Be where you want to be
Just as long as it's not here
Well I'm back and stronger
And the first one's always free
And it lasts much longer
You can bet your sanity
Never more the victim cries
As I slip beneath the skin
Like the Shadow of The Wind
The Shadow of The Wind
If words had names like red and green
And two for sympathy
Black and white and in between
Then you'd be misery
Every day is an inquisition
Who are you? What are you? Why?
I'm alive, I belong, I'll be back
It's a half truth, still a whole lie
In the garden of good and evil
You'll come, but you know
The spider only spins
The Shadow of The Wind
The Shadow of The Wind
Remember Freddie and Jo?
The night you went to the show?
(A monster movie);
Clutchin' at yer hand
(Wait ten seconds)
Clutchin' at yer arm
(Wait ten seconds)
Clutchin' at yer elbow
(Wait ten seconds)
Where did your brassiere go?
When the monster came out,
'N everybody shout!
People all around you,
Screamin' at the monster;
The Monster From The U.S.O.
Who's this dude with his hair straight back?
His new white socks, 'n his pants all black;
His T-shirts rolled
His watch is gold
A '55 Chevy that his brother just stoled,
With his arm's around yer waist
An' his hand is in yer pants
An' he asks you for a date
To the servicemen's dance!
Suppose you don't wanna?
What can you do?
When a joker like that
Got his hands on you
Oh, baby!
T-T-T-Tell me baby,
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.O.?
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.O.?
Lift up your dress, if the answer is "no"...
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way?
Would you come to me
If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave
Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up
The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating
Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips
Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message
Scalding, my dead father
An island of lost souls
Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery
The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days
Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He bought them presents with every coin he made
Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said, "No more" to
The little bombardier
Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardier
How did the group get together?
They were working, uh . . . the lead singer Ray, the bass player Roy, and one of the drummers, Jim, were all working in a bar, in a small town in California, with some other players, and there was a fight between Ray and the guitar player they had at that time, and they needed a substitute guitar player and they called me up. I went down there, and I started working with 'em, and I thought it sounded pretty good.
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby
Not your baby
Say my babe
She's so fine
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby
Not your baby
Say my babe
She's so fine
She's right there to love me
People, come rain or shine
Well, I love her
Don't you love her
Say I love her
You hear
Well, I love her
Don't you love her
Say I love her
You hear
She upsets my soul
When she whispers sweet things in my ear
I love the way she walk
I love the way she talk
She makes me feel so good
Just like a grown man should
She never make me cry
And here's why
She's my babe
She's my babe
Well, nothing could be better
Than to see her in a sweater
And a real tight skirt
That won't quit
Nothing could be better
Than to see her in a sweater
And a tight skirt
That won't quit
She walks to the phone
People, let me tell you, that's it
Wow! Go . . .
Hey!
Nothing could be better
Than to see her in a sweater
And a real tight skirt
That won't quit
Nothing could be better
Than to see her in a sweater
And a tight skirt
That won't quit
She walks to the phone
People, let me tell you, that's it
My-y-y-y-y babe
Oh, oh-oh-oh, my babe
My-y-y-y-y babe
Oh, oh-oh-oh, my babe
My-y-y-y-y babe
She's my babe

My-y-y-y-y babe
Oh, oh-oh-oh, my babe
My-y-y-y-y babe
She's my babe
She's my babe
Wow!
Gracias.
And this time is all there is
Do you remember the time we...?
And all the times we...?
And should have...?
And were going to...?
I know
And I know you remember
How we could justify it all
And we knew better
In our hearts we knew better
And we told ourselves it didn't matter
And we chose to continue
And none of that matters anymore
In the hour of our twilight
And soon it will be all said and done
And we will all be back together, as one
If we will continue at all
Shame on us, doomed from the start
May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done
And all we ever were, just zeroes and ones
And you never get away
And you never get to take the easy way
And all of this is a consequence
Brought on by our own hand
If you believe in that sort of thing
And did you ever really find
When you closed your eyes
Any place that was still
And at peace?
And I guess I just wanted to tell you
As the light starts to fade
That you are the reason
That I am not afraid
And I guess I just wanted to mention
As the heavens will fall
We will be together soon, if we
Will be anything at all
Shame on us, doomed from the start
May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done
And all we ever were, just zeroes and ones
Shame on us (shame on us), doomed from the start
May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done (shame on us)
And all we ever were just, (just) zeroes and ones
Uh-uh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah
You belong to the city (uh-uh-uh, what what)
You belong to the night (uh-uh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah)
In the river of darkness
He's a man of the night
What the deal, playboy? Just rest your soul
I be holding it down yo, still love the dough
Got these ladies on the cock, now you know how we go
Got the whole world on lock down, you know how we flow
Don't worry about Brooklyn, I continue to flame
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
You held it down long enough, let me take those reigns
And just like your spirit, the Commission remains
Niggas can cross the Ts and, dots the Is
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm taking this rap shit serious, to my demise
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise
Basics in the basement, wasted
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit
My hatred is, fueled just give me a sign
And I let the world know that the city is mine, what?
You belong to the city (the city is mine, what-what-what)
You belong to the night (ge-ge-geyeah, uh-uh-uh, pa-pau)
In the river of darkness
He's a man of the night (the city is mine, that's right)
Y'all wanna know how I flow just seek and you find
I'm like a brain in the voice box, I speak my mind
About to redefine rap mami, either I'm
The illest nigga doing it or these niggas is losing it
I read a article that said I was ruining shit
But every time I look, I'm moving units in quick
So I'ma hit y'all with these last two and split
And leave niggas with nothing but my influences-es
Students of Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit
Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit
I'm the type to buy a Rollie and just ice my shit
On the spot, fuck coming back twice to shit
How real is that? My floss game, still intact
Boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that
Like the first dude to cop the 850 in '89
And drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what?
You belong to the city (the city is mine)
You belong to the night (yeah, uh, the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (pa-pause, feel me)
He's a man of the night (yeah, yeah, bounce, bounce)
I snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough
Plus y'all don't stay in the studio long enough
I make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks
Had it locked 'til I came in the club, Take 6
Got your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent
Got her a Chinese manicure, hair done by Dominicans, all for what
So I could be in a dark corner, all in her butt
At the bar alchoholing her up
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
A buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name
I ain't a player, get it right, I'm controlling the game
From now until they blow holes in my frame
I'ma stand firm, holding my aim, feel me?
I'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime
You belong to the city (uh-huh, yeah, the city is mine)
You belong to the night (ah ah, the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (feel me, the city is mine)
He's the man of the night (the city is mine, is mine, is mine, is mine)
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
In the river of darkness
He's the man of the night
You belong
You belong
In the river of darkness
He's the man of the night
Oh yeah, uh-oh
Y'all know who it is (He's back)
Young!
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with me (Woo), just grind to the bassline (Come on)
Niggas, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside
Now what the fuck they're gon' do with me?
Got money, got broads, got a crew with me
Real as banana clips, I got a zoo with me
Get down or lay down, nigga, to shoot with me
Now how the fuck they're gon' deal with me?
I ain't going nowhere, they gotta deal with me
Got the whole BK ready to kill with me
You scared, motherfucker? Keep it real with me, keep it real with me
Now what the fuck they're gon' say to me?
Got to clap, ya mean? All day with me, clap, ya mean?
Don't play with me, clap, ya mean?
Stay with me, don't lose me, y'all
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different
I bought it back for a living
Thirty-three Os on a bitch back like Pippen
Three she can keep for herself and distribute
Thirty-six Os and a ki', you do the addition
Before Mitchell and Ness did it
I was moving birds like a Oriole fitted
I'm Cal Ripken Jr. let's get it
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab it from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside
Mami, what they're gon' say to you?
Got your hair did and your favorite shoes
Tell 'em don't play with you, get 'em away from you
You need a baller like I, call 'em like I
See 'em like, "Nah"
Move over, y'all amateurs
No, you not balling, that's Pro-Am shit
Oh, stop calling, that's ho-man shit
Stop falling asleep, that's old man shit
I stands up in it like a champ up in it
Be up in it so long, get my calls transferred in it
No more minute man in it
Get my SoundScan, BDS, and Marketing plans in it
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Line)
Homie, don't be scared to grab it from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside (What they're gon' do?)
You got starch in your flow, I flow too many ways
Got a arch in my flow, all sorts of flow
Rembrandt, Rilke, I am art with the flow
Even if I'm guilty, you gotta pardon the flow
Niggas takin' it lightly, had to darken the flow
Way I put it together, tear 'em apart with the flow
I'm too smart with the flow, you just started to flow
Stop it youngin, you 106th & Park with the flow
I am pro, as you see, I'm off the charts with the flow
Actually, I'm number one on the charts with the flow
In some places they say this, I am God with the flow
Like my office, but they're biased, too involved with the flow
Although I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow
Trouble Man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow
I come up hard but I evolve with the flow
Crossover, slam dunk, Rucker Park with the flow (Young)
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab it from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside
Born to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes
Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time
God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes
Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison
I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear
The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This, I swear!
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you my part-time lover
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek its really you my part-time lover
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers
All that is, was and will be
Universe much too big to see
Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out to the

Twisting

Ask forever
Twisting

Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence
Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless
Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral
Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral
Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution
Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin
Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again
Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn
Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do that fistful will
Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction
Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction
So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again
Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Addicted to the
Fame

To let 'em know what a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full 'o vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hold us
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get your damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty ya'll got-ta feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get your damn hands up!
Yeah
Hove is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs no
Hove did that so hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back, selling their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things is great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude, I gets bizzay
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get your damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty ya'll got-ta feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get your damn hands up!
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh!
Yeah!
Turn on... I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
One hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh
Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah!
Take the corner, join the crash
Headlights, head on, headlines
Another junkie lives too fast
Yeah lives way too fast, fast, fast, oohhOH!
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Yeah-heah
White knuckle tight!
Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
My desire
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh
On I burn
I left my heart, in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars
Climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air
I don't care, my love waits there
In San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me
Will shine for me, oh, oh
"1-2, 1-2-2"
Shiruetto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru
Mo tengoku no giyu no kaidan wa nai
Silhouettes and shadows
Watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven!
It's no game
Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Nani ga okkote irunoka wakara nai
Doko ni kyokun wa arunoka hitobito wa yubi o orareteiru
Konna dokusaisha ni iyashime rareru nowa kanashii
I am bored from the event
I really don't understand the situation!
And it's no game
Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
You throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday
And it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain
And it makes all the papers
Nammin no kiroku eiga
Hyoteki o se ni shita koibito tachi
Michi ni ishi o nage reba kona gona ni kudake
Kino ni huta o sureba kyohu wa masu
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba
Shinbun wa kaki tateru
So where's the moral
When people have their fingers broken?
To be insulted by these fascists
It's so degrading
And it's no game
Shut up!
Shut u
A flake of snow within a storm
A new way waiting to be born
In a world with need of change
A touch of love in fear of hate
A rushing wind that's asked to wait
For the promises of rain
A pearl of wisdom entrapped by poverty
She gives love with purity
Filling minds with hopeful schemes
To build worlds enhanced by peace
Draped in sparkling morning dew
She expresses life anew
From the earth beneath her feet
She is a flower that grows
In love ability
She's femininity
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they make you begin
When they know in time you'll find your truth
before your cycle ends
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why are you crying their fears
When the true reflection of you that they see
Is love besieged by years
She has touched the farthest star
Her beauty speaks of what we are
And her freedom makes us free
Her now is in eternity
Infinite to all that see
And her dreams have been achieved
Now there is a sound of laughter
Nature signs out her name
For the world to know her fame
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they criticize
When they knew your love could cast its spell and
consecrate their eyes
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why do you linger in space
When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place
When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place
When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone
So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done
When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit
So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done
Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss
When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame
So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done
Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile veins
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate
So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done
Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss
Judas lives recite this vow
I've become your new god now
Follow you from dawn of time
Whisper thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured the children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown
In the heart of evil man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
Strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all
So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss
Dig a hole, bury yourself, nigga!
Go head! Keep going!
I got some nice dresses for you guys
The incomparable H.O
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss coming (Yes)
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
Nothing left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered)
And now what's that you talking bout we gon' see now (We gon' see now)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Go ahead)
Dig a hole (Motherfucker bury yourself)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
I'm still here, mon frere!
I know the cross I bear
They're like, "That's why they call you Hov"
I'm like, "Yeah"
I'm like air, little shots go through me
Won't tear one tissue, no tears, no tissue, not an issue
Don't cry for me
I peep these niggas from deep
Got a front row seat even if you don't speak
Silent partner, I hear you loud and clear
Left a fingerprint, you ain't gotta be there
I'm just waiting 'til you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in
Then I'm gon' body them
It's nothing but a hobby to him
Simple as a serve in volley to him
Niggas like, "Hov', why don't you get at ol' boy?"
Why kill a puppet and leave Geppetto alive?
Why not wait to catch them all together?
That's why you dig one big hole, one time
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss coming
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
Nothing left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered
And now what's that you talking bout we gon' see now (Uh! We gon' see now)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Go ahead, bury yourself)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Go ahead)
How is niggas dissing me
I made it possible
For niggas to make history
How is this possible?
Please explain this shit to me
How is it logical?
Have we forgotten our history?
Let's open our bibles
It's like the disciples, dissing Jesus and becoming his rivals
Shunning the one thing that they owe their life to
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Knowing good and god damn well this what I do
Think I'm in the office, I'm off my grind?
That's how kids become orphans
You lost ya mind?
I keep my enemies close
I give 'em enough rope
They put themselves in the air
I just kick away the chair
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss coming (Uh, uh, uh!)
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
Nothing left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Uh-huh)
And now what's that you talking bout we gon' see now (We gon' see now)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Go ahead, bury yourself)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Go ahead, bury yourself)
Hov gon' get you, I ain't forget your little disrespect
No ho, daddy gon' spank you for that shit you said
It's hard to do when you've got nothing to prove
Everybody know you better, you in a lose lose
Cause even when you win, ultimately you lose
Real niggas like, "Why Hov talking to Dude?"
You selling low too, only time you went plat
My chain was on your neck, that's an actual fact
So I'm praying that it spills outside of the booth
That's when ya'll niggas outside of your truth
Outside of your league, that's not what you do
Niggas throwing Roc signs outside of your Coupe
Don't look at Hov like he done something wrong to 'em
Cause he's on to 'em
He just took what belonged to him
Niggas is playing checkers with chess-playing Hov
This game is over, I don't know if ya'll know
You in the hole
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss coming (Uh, uh, uh!)
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
Nothing left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Uh-huh)
And now what's that you talking bout we gon' see now (We gon' see now)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Go ahead, bury yourself)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Go ahead, bury yourself)
As you walk alone the night surrounds you like a shroud
The dreams you had were once of love and being proud
Misty horizons block your vision of the world
But the raven's eyes will show you all you need to know
The land you loved is now so barren and so cold
The name of God rings out so high in your soul
This time is masters will lead us by the sword
And should we fait them all prevails in Odin's court
Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartache
Before it takes me away from my mind
Send me love and I may let you see me
Send me hopes that can spin in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead
When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And then tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me
So realize I'm much better without you
You're not the one and only thing in my heart
I'll just go back to pretending I'm living
So this time I'm gonna have to depart
