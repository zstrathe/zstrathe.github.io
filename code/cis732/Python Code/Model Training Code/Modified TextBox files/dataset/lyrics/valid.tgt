I have a dress and a train
Make a harsh straight line
You're perfect
Let me follow in your footsteps
I'm a woman who likes men
I've never felt such stirrings
Was someone else
Crush me like a kick
Some blood that you could kiss
I wish there was a strap of blood
Tie me with a scarf and jewels
I beg you to degrade me
I am a secret lover
Please spit into my mouth
You're heartless and I love that
But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
Some lost appendage
You are my goliath
Oh I am mistress dread
I love you in my head
Kiss away kiss away
Kiss away
Just teach me to despise
Here within my lonely frame
But will it seem the same
(Come tomorrow) maybe a soldier
Now the trees are almost green
When time and tide have been
Please don't destroy these lands
Soon I hope that I will find
That won't disgrace my kind
Gas Rhonda!
Sunday!
You're welcome
My throat . . .
Fifty bucks a piece
Right
Blueprint, trois
What we talking 'bout? Real shit or we talking 'bout rhymes?
What we talking 'bout? 'Cause I ain't got time
What we talking 'bout? Fiction or we talking 'bout fact?
I'm talking 'bout life (Life, life)
I ain't talking 'bout profit, I'm talking 'bout pain
I ain't talking 'bout gossip, I ain't talking 'bout Game
I'm talking 'bout real shit, them people playing
People keep talking 'bout, "Hov, take it back!"
Ain't nothing cool 'bout carrying a strap
I'm talking 'bout revenge while carrying his casket
I'm talking 'bout music, I ain't talking 'bout rap
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
They talk, we live
I see what y'all talking about, ha ha
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?
Talking 'bout what I wear, talking 'bout where I be
Peasey head still get paid, I'm combing through Gs
'Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
You know I run track, try not to get lapped
Tryna rewrite history, let's talk about facts
He could've made more but he ain't sign his contract
That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
Blueprint 3
We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther
Posing with guns, shooting YouTube up
You stuck on being hardcore, I chuck the deuce up
Welcome to the Blue-ah-Print-ah tre-piece, Jay-Z your tutor
Rass clot when rude boy come through with the roof up
'Cause everybody talking Hov, I think we know why
They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
But if there is a God, we need Him now
That's what my friends ask me
'Cause we've got so far to come...
Why can't they say that hate is 10 zillion light years away
Why must my color black make me a lesser man
He loves us all, that's what my God tells me
Feel His spirit wow oh woo...
I... can't say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray
For those who don't believe will never see the light
No people, "where is your God?"
But if you open your heart you can feel it yeah yeah
Feel it, feel His spirit, wow oh wow...
I opened my heart one morning and
Feel His spirit yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The adventures of GREGGERY PECCARY!
Little GREGGERY PECCARY
Wild swine...
Catalina, Catalina, Catalina!
Bold...
Breed...
That distinguishes itself by markings which resemble a WIDE TIE directly below the white collar
Everyone will know
Is a symbol
Ooh-ooh!
Hoon-hoon hoonna-han
Look out!
Oh here comes GREGGERY PECCARY
Hoonna-han
Voodn, Voodn!
Voo-voo-voo-nya-hoon
And what, might you ask, is a TREND MONGER? Well, a TREND MONGER is a person who dreams up a TREND (like 'The Twist' -or 'Flower Power'), and spreads it throughout the land, using all the frightening little skills that Science has made available!
Hi Mildred!
WANDA!
Is there any mail for me?
THIS IS BIG SWIFTY'S!
(WO-WO)
FOR ANY GIMMICK OR GIZMO!
IN A SERIES OF COLORFUL
AIR HOCKEY... biff... dush-h-h!
YOUP YOUP YOUP YOUP
AIN'T YOUR LIFE BORING, DON'TCHA THINK?
LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER
TO DO!
I must plummet boldly forward to my ultra-avant laminated, simulated replica-mahogany desk, with the strategically-placed, imported, very hip water pipe, and the latest edition of the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG, and rack my agile mind for a spectacular new TREND, thereby rejuvenating our limping economy, and providing for bored & miserable people everywhere some great new 'THING' to identify with!
TO THE THINGS
WE HAVE GOT YOUR LITTLE TOYS!
BUSY MAKIN' 'EM,
BUSY MAKIN' EM
Yoo-hoo-hoo!
And with that, GREGGERY turned and strode nonchalantly into his dinky little office with the desk and the catalog and the very hip water pipe, and proceeded, with a vigor and determination known only to piglets of a similarly diminutive proportion, to single-handedly invent THE CALENDAR!
SUNDAY
WOW!
'MONDAY - MONDAY'!
And thus THE CALENDAR, in all of its colorful disguises was presented to the bored & miserable people everywhere!
What hath GOD wrought?
Making his way through the evening traffic, GREGGERY notices that the other vehicles which crowd and bump his little red car are all inhabited by slowly-aging 'VERY HIP YOUNG PEOPLE.'
To elude them, GREGGERY takes the SHORT FOREST EXIT off the expressway. They zoom after him in all manner of cars, trucks, garishly-painted buses, and motorcycles.
Meanwhile, the enraged HUNCHMEN (and HUNCH-WOMEN) rumble through the SHORT FOREST until (realizing the little swine has escaped), they decide to park their steaming vehicles in a circular pseudo-Wagon Train formation... and have a LOVE-IN!
WHAT?
Phew!
HO! HO! HO!
Good Lord! What was that?
BILLY THE MOUNTAIN!
WHO IS MAKING THOSE NEW BROWN CLOUDS?
BETTER ASK A PHILOSTOPHER 'N SEE WHAT HE SAYS!
IS THIS THE OLD LOFT
BY THE CHINESE POLICE
IS THIS WHERE THEY KEEP
WITH THE RUGS & THE DUST,
HOW MANY YEZ GOT?
JUST SITTIN' AROUND THERE
WELL I JUST CALLED YEZ UP
A PHILOSTOPHER BE
GREGGERY receives information that 'The Greatest Living PHILOSTOPHER Known to Mankind' is currently in possession of the very information in question, and, furthermore, this information could be HIS, if only GREGGERY would attend a 'SPECIAL THERAPEUTIC GROUP ASSEMBLY' (Classes now forming), and available at a special low low introductory fee... and now, here he is, 'The Greatest Living PHILOSTOPHER Known to Mankind', QUENTIN ROBERT DeNAMELAND! Take it away!
Make your checks payable to 'QUENTIN ROBERT DeNAMELAND, Greatest Living Philostopher Known to Mankind'!
THAT YOU PAYS!
Ain't they know it, when it comes to love
And the girls respect me for it (you gotta respect that)
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Holler at ya when I come off tour
Who you with, who you wanna be fucking?
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
In and out I'm moving through her student body union
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
She said, I ain't no fool I'll make it up in summer school
Girls, I do adore
'Cause I would love to date ya
I'm trying girls out
Huh, who you loving, who you wanna be fucking?
Got this model-slash-actress-slash-part-time waitress
All they do is dish dirt and put her up on my latest
I tend to carry more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines
Our time apart is our time apart
And some day, I slow down, but for now, I get around
Or Caine and O-Dog, stick up tape from Menace
Put your number on this paper
I'm trying girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
One who likes to party but come home early
Slim, kinda thick, I swear I love 'em all
But she can get you first class seats for coach prices
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
And the girls respect me for it
To choose one from
Just trying girls out (Until I find the one for me)
Things that don't come easily
Icicles are in my brain
Winter's ice, it soon was dead
Makes me happy, makes me cold
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
I feel there's no place freezing me
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Soon I'll feel the chilling go
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
This is where I feel I belong
Turn my days to frozen hours
Will my ice age ever come?
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Cry out to legions of the brave
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Bloodied angels fast descending
Phantom figures free forever
Neon Knights!
Turn, turn me up a little bit, when that music comes in it gets loud
Yes! Hands up! Hands up! Hands up high!
(It be very different now, Swizzy)
(Oh oh oh!)
Slow down Hov, you're killing 'em
I been hitting so long and I'm a big headed boy
Though I might pick up some weight when I'm running through your state
We on the runway in back to back Lairs (in the air)
And Barack Obama rhymers, feel honored (talk to 'em Hov)
You act like y'all don't wanna pay me for the facts
I just bare my soul I don't expect nothing back (get it up)
I was gon' get mine, you know where the hell I'm from
Quick fast, turn the Big Apple into cider
Spew it 'cause I'm nicer, but I do this for the lifers (tell 'em again Hov)
Spew it 'cause I'm nicer, but I do this for the lifers, you're welcome
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
You all are welcome
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!
Somebody so deadly via the pen (no, never, no)
Big up to Biggie and Pac, I do it for them
Do it for those who can't do for self due to the pen
And Ma, when Mary sing it heals your heart (hands up!)
Love Is A Battlefield, we all get scarred
This is much more than marketed music
As there's people going through pain, I'm just walking 'em through this
People going through pain, I'm just talking 'em through it, you're welcome
And you made our dreams come true
'Cause we do this all for you (talk to 'em Mary!)
Because we were going through it too
We were always there to hold your hand
I also said, "Watch the man hopping out of vans"
I told you how to fish and not let other niggas feed you, you're welcome
Working my hands until they bleed
I'd still be half of what you need
Anything you ask you know I'll do
Ringfinger
Deeper than the sea
And offer it to me
Hanging like Jesus on this cross
And aiding to the cause
Confessions I see through
When I get part of you
A promise carved in stone
Do something for me
And the squeaking of the bed is right in time with the song that's repeating in my head
"When I do it, I only think of you"
Yeah.
Last night?
I wasn't here last night.
Oh, sure this is ridiculous.
No, tell me. Please tell me.
M-hmm.
There have been summonses.
What, me personally, or the studio?
I don't know how many, but there's a court case pending right now . . .
ONE! ONE! And how many times have I, eh, uh, hey listen! As I say, if I've been up here once I've been up here twenty times already.
Yeah, well, I understand, he didn't know . . .
Here he is.
IN charge
Are you in charge?
Alright, listen, lemme tell you one thing . . .
You're in charge at this point
My name is Patrolman Lefemine
Now, as of tonight . . .
If I come back here, and every night that I do come back here, I don't care who says he's in charge, I will issue a summons.
An' anybody thinks it's a great joke, you can all laugh in the court.
But, uh . . .
We have, we have to . . .
You know what I mean. This is ridiculous!
Yeah . . .
Who gets, who gets the summonses, is the, the organization?
Alright. Take care.
Nighty-night!
I stray from the light.
Help me make it through the night.
And murder in mind.
Now, my body is my shrine.
Give me no wine; you keep the bread.
Is God alive or is God dead?
Revel of evil,
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal and borrow, there is no tomorrow,
Ashes to ashes.
Who do you curse when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust,
When will this nightmare be over, tell me?
Will someone tell me the answer,
To safeguard my philosophy until my dying breath,
I empathize with enemies until the time is right
I watch the rain as it turns red,
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
Or is it just a holy fairy tale and God is dead?
Right!
The blood pours down, the rain turns red.
As if they've never seen a heart in love
Cuz, I'm too busy thinking bout our love
I wake up to that love glow in your eyes
I will not stop my daydreaming
Ooh baby, my love is on fire
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire
I need to feel your love mixed with mine
As if you're witness to my every word
Something within me tells me they'll be heard
When my love fantasies will come to life
Then I'll be living truth, those moments
On flute, Hubert Laws
Ooh fire Ooh fire
Can't cha feel the fire burning?
Yeah yeah, mixed with mine
He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would `pear
Junior cried, the day that his best friend died
They're coming home again tomorrow
With all the pain I've watched you live within
When it is time to say goodbye
His father was leaving, and Junior's grieving again
Junior's sorrow, who knew what tomorrow would bring?
Now he knew well, this life was hell for sure
Reaching for reason, along with the time and the stars
She gets inside
Anything you've tried
The blackest sea
Dare to dream it could be
Wave goodbye
The rules have changed
She makes you hard
You've finally found
I cannot go through this again
Keeps holding on
Whilst flying through an azure cloud
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
I wish to sing the chicken song
I'd give my jewels and caviar
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
While stepping through a heaven's eye
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No gifts of money do we give
Ngh...
I have stripped of all but pride
And she keeps me satisfied
...and with dust in throat I crave
To the game you stay a slave
Nomad, vagabond
But I'll take my time anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Where I lay my head is home
I adapt to the unknown
By myself but not alone
...and my ties are severed clean
Off the beaten path I reign
And I'll never mind anywhere
And I'll take my find anywhere
My body lie but still I roam
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
You've been filling me all full of lies
You will bear someone else's bitter seed
Now I know just what you're looking for
Well you know that it was he not me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
You sure wish that you could see me dead
I'm depressed by the grin
I should have thought of that
Like a black-hearted violin
It's too many lonely nights
I can't pass you by
You've been around
Where the flesh meets the spirit world
I slip from a vacant view
Like a black-hearted vile thing
I can't tell good from bad
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!
It is I, sire, Tone from Brooklyn
News from the east, sire
Mirror mirror on the wall
I love 'em all, but none of y'all
With the suicide doors, fuck 'em all
When we throw it in the air, everybody hit the floor
When we boys, so we bringing out them toys
Wiggie, you annoyed man, when the year change, we change
We can go clip for clip, nigga, chain for chain
That I keep by my hip, like my celly that rings
While Jay and Tone on the way to the after-party
Best of both worlds, and we rock the club
Boy H-O, Kells, we not playing
And win again, like deja vu
Three-peat, then we retreat to waters that's blue
In this arena, arena
This is for them hustling boys and girls
Now all the ladies love Kells, cuz Kells is fresh
I got a fat gold chain and a drop top Lex'
Man I'm a gigolo, air force ones and fresh linen
Ladies line up in a single filed line
Best of best worlds, getting it down, you know I mean
Step off in the club, so fresh and so clean
Hov' rapping, I sing, sing, sing
Before we do a show, it's like ching, ching, ching
We don't start fights, we don't bother nobody
Bad news, is, it's the return of best of both
Going each and every where with the mic in our hands
Detroit, from Chitown, to Cali
Philly, Jersey, Dallas, St. Louie
She's mostly gone some other place
Everything they whispered in our ear is coming true
I am here right beside you
I am staying right beside you
I've come to realize, we all have our place
And I have my role in this:
And I am here right beside you
And I am staying right beside you
Ticking time is running out
Oh, so tired on my own
Yesterday I found out the world was ending
Every day
Slips away
I'm okay
These four walls are closing in
Watch young lovers walking by
Nothing ever
While we can
Always were, yeah
Stay with me
While I'm still here
I know you better than I know myself
You are a part of me
Give it up
You don't judge
You can't hurt me
Me to use
I know you best, better than one might think
It's time to die a little. Give it up
Got no place to go
Up and down the street all by myself)
(I tried and tried
Why should I pretend I like
Maybe I'll just kill myself
Because
Everything I've tried
Life has been abusing me
If I was gone
Who'd care if I was dead and gone)
To care for them
Tell me why should I just hang around?)
While the others smile
If I were happy for a little while
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Happiness for a gangster, ain't no love in these streets
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question existence until them questions are solved
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and
Losing my religion, losing my religion
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
These are verses from the Bible
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh
Are the cards that we play, play, play
When the shots spray, spray, spray
His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying
Spirit of man, cannot be freed
When death calls - the spirit of man can be freed
When death calls - just an evil shadow
For I believe, Satan lives, in the souls of dying
When death calls - feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When death calls - you're gonna burn
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Can't die until Satan says, you die
In the face of death or your tongue will blister
With all his wrath he calls the reper
When death calls - I can feel it, gonna take you down
Was she ever?
At the wrong time
From the gallery
Singing, "Come to me."
All the lights are fading now
Just one living chance
When the father steps aside
Was she ever here?
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life away
With a language we all understand
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
Don't make it in the groove
When the people start to move
They can feel it all over people
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
That time will not allow us to forget
And the king of all Sir Duke
There's no way the band can lose
You can feel it all over people
Can't you feel it all over
Everybody - all over people
You understand? You know, once you memorize a sentence
Y'all niggas can't be serious right now
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now:
Most charisma, I set the most trends
I jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring
I spring train in the winter, 'round early December
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
And I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
Push up on my money (push up), I'm in great shape dunny (woo!)
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch
The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is
Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
Then y'all niggas better squat, I drop your set for rep
Lyrical exercise, y'all niggas ain't tired right?
Two (and, and, and) two
(And) four, breathe easy
Suckers, get your weight up, not your hate up
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy
I lift every voice when I sing, my ability
Bring your squad, biceps, triceps, and quads
Y'all ain't real, that's y'all Achilles' heel
I spot ya, I lift the weight of the watch
Put down your things, Trinidad of the game
No matter how many pounds you bring
R-O-C is the strongest team, fuckers
We're the fire that remains (Turn Rell up a little bit)
Geah! (Hoo!)
Locally accepted, Roc-A-Fella Records
Doing what we do, B. Sig. (It's the Roc, baby)
Free, Young H-O, Bleek (You understand, oh, oh)
It's Young C (Young C!) home of Philly, young and hungry
And every hood in the world discussing me
It's Neef Buck (Neef Buck) out the cut (Out the cut, geah, geah)
It ain't a game, niggas know that they Toys 'R' Us
(I'm the one!) Man I'm money, hoes, clothes and shows
(I'm not done!) Man, I'm the shit after it's all said and done
(Quick fast) Like rapid refund
(I'm not done!) I'm Omillio
Come here, hon'! (Chill!)
All them haters talking shit, we don't like it
With my Mac (Mac) and my Tec (Tec)
For them niggas that be thinking Mack Milly
I'm that gallstone trapped in the belly of the beast
And we will not leave you, never
As one (Aw)
Move, working the wheel, hand jerking the V
But I'm on like Chris when he popped his cus'
Call me P.C.!
The fitted tilt to the left, the shirt blend with the sweats
Don't stare, take a picture, nigga, packing the bills
What you think I do to the brain of that dame you brung?
Make a run with the Roc, rock Air Force 1s
It's Hov, the hustler; I'm having one hell of a run!
I got a mami with a body, don't touch it
You get nothing, we get enough spins
It's the R-O-C forever, tell the public, huh!
Do you crawl to your corner and cry,
Just a secret to take when you die.
Screaming sinner.
Making darkness a place you despise,
Are you sure he was there from the start.
Every tongue is screaming sinner, only satan hears your cries.
And your futures looking grim, but did you ever give a damn
When you sin cardinal sin, don't you expect the world will treat you well,
We point the finger, sin cardinal sin, laugh in your face, sin
We point the finger, laugh in your face,
Oh sin cardinal sin, oh sin cardinal sin.
Now he thinks he's a fire engine
Kinda smells kinda cool kinda funny anyway
I had a friend once he took some ecstasy
He was sort of loving kinda caring,
It got a bit messy all over the curtains,
I'm getting bored again...
The way I feel is the way I am
Just to you
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you
The hateful image of another man
Yeah for you
Yeah with you
Yeah began
Will they still dig now you're through
You bought and sold me with your lying words
Yeah came true
Yeah that's you
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
All of the promises that never came true
Ah, that's true
You've changed a lot since it began
Vultures sucking gold from you
Cats, rats
And find yourself another way
Leave the living for another day
You are nonentity, you have no destiny
A mental picture of a stolen soul
A smiling face, it means the world to me
My life it started some time ago
I thought I was so good
I feel my world is torn apart
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind
Listen to me while I sing this song
Too many people advising me
If it don't I feel I'll blow my mind
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
If I could find one then everything would be alright
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail
You've got me coming, You've got me going around
Gotta be good 'cause then everything will be OK
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day...
Why didn't ya try, didn't ya try
No matter who I take home
And you...
You're The One, babe
Who's lovin' ya now
And I can't sleep at all
Just to wait for your call
I can't say what's right or what's wrong
All ya gotta do is call me, babe
You make me feel
I got so hung up on you
That no matter how I try,
From running down my face,
(Baby... )
I stayed home all afternoon, man
I fixed the upholstery
We were going to go to the drive-in
I waited, it was Friday night, I remember, man
I was still watching television and you didn't try to call me
And... I thought you were my teen-age thrill
But you didn't call me
If you could have seen me in the afternoon
I, I reprimered the right front fender, man
And get some root beer afterwards, man
And I was gonna show everybody my new carburettor
It's against my uniform
All the songs are history now
Let us cast our minds back
You took up all the vandals
And we're sad and sorry
Yes we're sad and sorry
Compare ourselves with others
Oh, God what a terrible
There must be some way out of here
If we cannot work it out
We cannot go on in those days
Yeah, I'm talking `bout sisters as well
Good luck!
Chain the hope you take on, liar
We're on fire, we're on fire, yeah...
, stronzo di merda
I couldn't sleep overnight because of you
Ohhhh you really hurt me
You called me an asshole?
Pezzo di merda
My heart beats too fast
Youyou suck
Fai proprio schifo
, ah
.
- Shit of shit / asshole of shit
- Piece of shit
- Go take it in the ass
My baby's got
Well my baby's got
That little girl's got the jones
She's tryin' to
Well, she's tryin'to
She can push; she can shove
Just a nub
With her red dress on
From the sprinklers on the lawn
On the concrete fawn
'Cause the sky is gone
Jones crusher
She's a Jones crusher,
Tried so hard to be like you
Lost my faith in everything
Taste the wealth of hate in me
This machine is obsolete
Drink the fountain of decay
Fuck the rest and stab it dead
Too fucked up to care anymore
In the back, off the side, and far away
Tried to say, tried to ask, I needed to
How could I ever think, it's funny how
Just like you would always say, we'll make it through
Everything you swore would never change is different now
Didn't quite, fell apart, where the fuck were you?
Free fucking speech
Is the answer in her smile?
Is it in the nick of time?
Do you know it all in just one day?
How will I know she cares?
So easy to feel you're there
Well, I have no problem waiting, waiting
Is the answer in her glance?
Or in the moment that feels oh so right
Or the magic of his kiss
It hard for true love to find you, find you
For true love one of a kind
Face mountains we think we can't climb
You feel like giving up
But then you hear a voice in your mind
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
'Til the day that life is said and done
With rivers we think we can't cross
You say you're at you're end
But then a light comes on in your mind telling you to
If you wanna hold on to something
If you want to hold on to something
To your love
It's 'cause they have none of their own
Hold your head up high
And know that you are never alone
Like a mother to her child
And do your best to always wear a smile
Brooklyn, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Agh!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
There's no fear in my eyes where they're looking at
Besides, me nah like to eye fight
But if a man test my Stuy
Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial
Chain snatching, ain't have it, gotta get it
Fatherless child, Mama pulled double shifts
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fiddith
Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
I jack, I rob, I sin
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
From Brooklyn corners, burning branches of sticky
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no intentions of returning tomorrow
Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
While I'm doing my time due to circumstance
Once bid ten, now I paid my dues
Get so dark, but I see good
Now, let it ring out, it's a warning
Gotta make it stick working like we blue collar
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Robbing out the commercial stash
The air is getting hotter
I've been wading through the high muddy water
Every day, your memory grows dimmer
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Oh, hey, yeah
They would not let me be
I only saw what they let me see
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
Oh, oh, yeah
Before they close the door
Waiting for the trains
Like pendulums swinging on a chain
You find out you can lose a little more
Trying hard to get to Heaven before they close the door
Oh-oh-oh
Going down to New Orleans
But I don't know what alright even means
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Trying to get to Heaven before they close the door, hey
Before they close the door (Woo, door)
Before they close the door (And relive my dreams there)
Hob-noblin
De Goblin Girl
She's black 'n green
Raggedy black
Little green shoes
On Halloween night
She's a Goblin Girl
She's a goblin
'Cause of the Goblin
Goblin Girl
To dress like a witch
Best way a girl
Is in a Goblin suit
When they're a goblin
I start a-wobblin'
Some is tan
From every land
From any which-a-way
You can hear me say:
(TRICK OR TREAT NOW...)
All the Goblin Girls
The little Goblin Girls
Some are dressed in green
But they're bad girls
(LEPRECHAUN LIGHT...)
But that's okay...
On the black guys in the band
Thinks they're seeing something
But Coy leaves the green gels in the truss
Really enjoy looking like they've got
Crawled away from me.
Tried to keep a hold,
Slid away from me.
Tried to keep you down,
That you don't wanna play?
don't mean that much to me.
If I could I'd stick a knife in.
This is love.
This is my love.
you
go.
Say, say.
Get it, get it, get it,
What you want and what you need
Eat your heart out, Steve
I want to take you out
Oh I want to twist and twist and shout
So soft on my bed
Oh when you wear that sweet dress
You're just too physical, physical no to me
I want this right in your ear
I let you make this feeling clear
The heat of your breath
That would be better unsaid
You're just too physical, oh
You're too physical to me
Too really fuck no
You're just too physical
No no no no no no no
Just too physical
"We've been... we've been trying something a little different this tour. We've been looking at one of our songs from a different angle, under a different light, so we can hopefully kind of see it almost for the first time. We'd like to try that for you tonight, is that okay? We're gonna need your help though. We're gonna need your help and your permission, so we need you to find a comfortable space, that's not only comfortable, but vulnerable. I want you to shut your eyes and go there, and we'll meet you on the other side..."
While you were begging me to stay
If I do, we both may disappear
And you as well, my dear
Pushed you away
Choke this infant here before me
Who am I to judge or strike you down?
And you're pushing me, and I'm shoving you
Bang my head upon the fault line
You still love me, you still love me
And we're pushing, and I'm shoving
And I'm pushing, and you're shoving
I feel alive when you touch me
Down
I am somewhere I don't wanna be, yeah
Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
Never want to see that place again
And you, as well, my dear
You minimize my movement anyway
Pushing and shoving
There's no love in fear
Hands around my back again
Terrified of what may come, yeah
As I claw your fucking throat away
Seize upon that moment long ago
So young and carefree
That place in time...so gold
You thought that all would last forever
Nothing can ever...and be in time
But can it be
So vividly
And yes you say
Too, fade away
So gold
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
All things that happen
Though gold
I'll bet you never seen it like this
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa
Come and get this cash from me, they call me Rain Man
Buried under so much stacks
I brought book bags of that bankroll, I'm a D-boy, baby they know
No roof in my car but I got mirrors on the ceiling
Tell me
Through the left eye, my POV
How's that for computer love? She rolled her eyes back
You turned my Maybach back seat into the Hotel De'Paris
You got a private show that's like Magic City
Let's role play, act like you want it
You throw that body, I'll throw them dollars
Have you ever seen a Grover Cleveland?
You know, you know, you hot like fire
Take it slow like Neo, when shots was fired
Rock-a-bye baby Jay-Z got notes like Mariah
I'm a D boy, their decoys, their money is lighter
This is sponsored by the Goodfellas
And the J to the A to the Y to the Z, bitch!
Magic City, Club Rolex, Sue's Rondevu
Try it out at home, it works baby, it work
Just put it on the floor baby
Powder and paint
Every magazine on every shelf
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
This girl is a lonely girl
Buys the Daily News
This girl is made of loneliness
For the boy that she once knew
And this girl is a lonely girl
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
This boy is made of envy
He doesn't have a limousine
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffeured cars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Pariah from society
A product of a virgin birth
Yes that's your fantasy
Be careful of what you might find
And see what my eyes see
Do you believe every word I say?
I'm your pariah
Ain't no messiah
An angel or the Antichrist
Pathetic in your own sad way
From taking my advice
Do you believe that I'm from Heaven?
The graven image of a pseudo icon
I'm not your saviour,
Don't look to me when your life is over
Curses rest on thee
All Eternity
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Grudges break your back
All you carry
Die as you suffer in vain
Die as you hold up the skies
How does it feel on your own?
Crushed under heavy skies
Circling the sun
What have you become?
Crown yourself the other savior
Masquerade as maker
Beaten down and broken
Overload, the martyr stumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
And if you see my friend
A single thin straight line
I thought we had more
I thought we had
As you are he
As we are all together
See how they fly, I'm crying
Waiting for the van to come
Stupid bloody Tuesday
You let your face grow long
They are the eggmen
Goo goo g' joob
Policemen sitting
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Pornographic priestess
You let your knickers down
Waiting for the sun
From standing in the English rain (nice tan)
Expert, texpert choking smokers
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
I'm crying
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
G-goo goo g' joob goo
Here comes the water
Are crumbling images
I scramble to reach higher ground
Or something to comfort me
Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine
And claim what is mine
And climb to a new place now
Thought I was high
I thought I was there
I was wrong
The water is rising up on me
But the truth has come to punish me instead
Cleanse and purge me
This is a state of emergency, bitches
I'm back
Hey, hey, hey! Uh! (Uh-huh!)
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, baby
And waves, and waves! Uh! (Show 'em what you got!)
Shit, I already gave the summer some
I'm just getting better with time, I'm like Opus One
Okay, show me what you got babe
Mami front, but I'm so determined
I ain't talking bout the 2-3
Jordan or James, makes no difference
Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recording
Shit, what you write is not important
For being brave they may applaud him
Aw baby, just ignore them
I got a drop, I just took off the top, it's your turn
Hands up and waves, and waves
Show me what you got, baby (Uh, uh!)
Why even fool with these other guys, they're all stingy
Gimme some head, gimme some brain
But if I get one night baby girl, I swear
I'll take you shopping, take long trips
I'll take you there, take my time
Ma, show me what you got
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap
Y'all got less than two months to get y'all thing together
Show me what you got, pretty lady (Ow!)
H-O, uh huh
Justin Blaze
Roc-A-Fella Records
Uh huh, peace!
Like a dog in heat
I like to tear up the street
Ya know I'm here to stay
You best get outta the way
But no, you can't turn me round
Ya know I'm tearing it down
You put me in my place
Then I crushed your face.
And sometimes you gotta start low
I got news, ya never got to go
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Ya know ya can't turn me round
Ya know I'm burnin' it down
I used to have a job
Depression came along
"Where'd they go, them good ol' days,
Now I'm in Hot-Plate Heaven,
Republicans is fine,
Democrats is fair,
Neither of 'em's REALLY right,
'Bout that Hot-Plate Heaven,
They really oughta go
They'd benefit to know
(I guess we're only dreamin',
That's ALL you get to dream
Nature didn't put me here,
It musta been some evil ol'
He's over there in Washington,
'Cause I'm in Hot-Plate Heaven
Things is slightly better now;
The misery of 'TRICKLE DOWN',
The Regal Presidential Style
But neither has my rags,
(I said) the Green Hotel
(Been there once) the Green Hotel
Neither has my rags
This is how
Push it away but it all comes back again
All the sin
Just like now
Time starts slowing down
(Please) I don't ever want to make it stop
Will you please complete me?
To fill me up
Turn to red
All my life
(Well guess what?)
Now everything is clear
I can disappear
Will you please complete me
She was 14 years of age
For the finger points at me
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
20th century dies
My attorney seems sincere
Lord get me out of here
This is your shadow on my wall
This is what I could've been
As the Twentieth Century dies
If time had not stood still
If I'd only paid my bill
This is my bunk with two sheets
This is what I could have been
All's well, all's well
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Lost in my circle
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
From Kether to Malkuth
From station to station
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once I could never be down
And oh, what will I be believing
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Drink to the men who protect you and I
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be hateful
I must be only one in a million
The European canon is here
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late, It's too late
He had a lot to say.
We'll miss him.
Yeah, so long.
Told us how you weren't afraid to die.
Don't cry, yeah,
Not all martyrs see divinity.
Standing above the crowd,
Ranting and pointing his finger
Yeah, no way, yeah, to recall
Like I care at all.
You sure could yell.
And so loud.
Warn while some child might chill, nine-one-two
Yeah, standing above the crowd,
Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so eager to identify with
Someone who seemed to feel the same,
And someone who would die for me.
Would you die for me?
Don't you step out of line.
Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?
Get off your fucking cross.
To ascend you must die.
For our sins and our lies.
I still recall the taste of your tears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
You make this all go away
And I'm starting to scare myself
I just want something I can never have
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
Grey would be the color if I had a heart
In this place it seems like such a shame
Everywhere I look you're all I see
You make it all go away
Just like they said
You chip away the old version of you
I'm safe in here
My voice just echoes off these walls
I see it all
I see the hell you put yourself through
I don't need anything at all
You will never ever ever ever get to me in here
Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall
There's no room for anger, we're all very small
From paradise
Won't someone invite them
Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
They're just older children, that's all, after all
With my words
But the thought just occurred
Live 'til your rebirth and do what you will
After all, after all
Vow from the start and a
Seasons may come and the
Through every time and space
From the bottom of my heart, I love you
If you're wondering just how long I'll love you
Me and my heart got a
Keep this love burning endlessly
People will go but know
Through all eternity you will have my love for always
Forever is a long, long time
Good morn or evening friends
I have serious news to pass on to every-body
Could mean the world's disaster
It's that
Don't delay
Hate's goin' round
Stop it please
The force of evil plans
And it will if we let it
We all must take
If love and peace you treasure
Oh that
don't delay
hate's goin' round
stop it please
People you know that
You know that hate's
goin' round
It's up to you cause
Don't-you've got to stop it please
Love's in need of love love today

Whatsa matter with the way I talk? (Valley Girl)
But I live in like in a really good part of Encino so it's okay (Valley Girl)
I'm like freaking out totally
Hi - I have to go to the orthodontist
But I have to wear a retainer
I'm freaking out
Like those things that like stick in your mouth
You like get saliva all over them
And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Much too young to focus
What no one wants to see
Just what you want to see
Me again, me
Spell only me
Look up to me,
Look up to me
Now see the black cloud up ahead
Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
While others spit that Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerate
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
Fuck y'all mean? Handling since a teen, I dish out
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
Watch how I'm walking, 'cause even the thoroughest niggas be NARC'in
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch a
Got the city drinking Cristals, re-up the fee
My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder
G.S. the fuck up, dree-ess the fuck up
All rhymers forget it like Alzheimer's
Talk to me!
"I want money like Cosby" Who wouldn't?
Niggas got them kinda dreams from jail
Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
One day you're cruising in your 7, next day, you're sweating, forgetting your lies
Hit with the RICO, they repo your vehicle
'Bout to start bitching, ain't you? Ready to start snitching, ain't you?
Aside from the fast cars, honies that shake their ass at bars
With the underworld dealers, carriers of MAC-millers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
And not playing, that goes without saying
Trying to escape my own mind, lurking the enemy
Dead fucking presidents to represent me (Whose)
No mercy for what we are doing
We don't need to feel the sorrow
War without end
We don't care what it meant
Another sorrow Another breath
as it eats its way across the land
Only the strong survive
We are ready to kill all comers
Attack
People are dying
Soldiers are hounding
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
Blood starts to flowing
The furious fighting
It all becomes frightening
No remorse
Against the world in which they have to live
They're tired of being pushed around
They'll fight the world until they've won
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
So you children of the world
If you want a better place to live in
Show the world that love is still alive
Or you children of today are
All right now, watch this... Let me tell you 'bout this song. This song was originally constructed as a drum solo. That's right. Now, after Terry learned how to play "The Black Page" on the drum set, I figured, well, maybe it would be good for other instruments. So I wrote a melody that went along with the drum solo, and that turned into "The Black Page, Part 1, The Hard Version." Then I said, well, what about the other people in the world who might enjoy the melody of "The Black Page" but couldn't really approach its statistical density in its basic form? So, I went to work and constructed a little ditty which is now being set up for you with this little disco type vamp. This is "The Black Page, Part 2, The Easy Teen-age New York Version." Get down with your bad selves so to speak to "The Black Page, Part 2."
Yeah, Frank!
I'm drunk
And I don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car
Maybe I'm all messed up
This is the only time I really feel alive
I just found everything I need
Well, I want to rip it up and swim in it until I drown
New Angels of Promise
We are the dead dreams
Take us to the edge of time
I'm a blind man and she's my eyes
You didn't feel us coming
It's always time
Don't fall apart now
We are the tabular lovers
Hold me tight
Going mad
Do I need a friend?
All the days of my life
All I've done
All you gave
I gave nothing in return
In red-eyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
Pleading for your gentle voice
I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul
Ballen von Zecken
Lachen von Feuer
Lachen von Tranen
Ooh ooh ooh awh . . .
(Sheets of drywall and roofing)
(Sheets of large deprived rumba)
A light shines down from heaven
At the right hand of God's big rumba
In sheets of plywood
And this is what he said
Mein Sofa!
Time will crawl
I would not challenge a giant
'Til the twenty-first century lose
He saw the sun in the night
And he never came down
'Til our mouths run dry
'Til our tails fall off
Full of white eyed fish
With no eyes at all
That melted metal and steel
That lasted three long years
Made my fingers disappear
You were a talented child
We never bothered to scream
We only smelt the gas
And our heads bowed down
And the streets run red
And our feet grow small
For the crazy child
For the crackpot notion
We could run when the rain slows
Where the heat goes
We should crawl under the bracken
Everything has changed
And nothing has changed
(In your fear)
(Seek only peace)
(In your fear, seek only love)
Now we must burn
Rise together
As on wings
And this the business we take
All my trials
You, what you looking at?
Know your place, don't ever forget
And there is not a single thing here I can recognize
I'll give anything, I'll give anything
All your hate, what you've become
All used up half way through
And I'll give anything, you know, I'll give anything
When you crawl on your hands and your knees
Wait your turn, while they finish you off
Should have found out, should have happened by now
After all this time and I still haven't found my place
So high so far to fall
I don't feel any thing at all
Start it up again, like it matters anymore
Is this really all that there ever was?
Close your eyes, blow my fucking brains out
That's enough for you, but I still need more, more, more
I don't feel anything
Sweet and still there's pain (pain, pain, pain)
My nephews would have grew up to do the same (same, same)
And my influence is the same
They ask if you ashamed (ashamed)
I cannot so my answer to you remains
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes
Just big boats and tearing the coast up
For any coupe, bear-hugging the holster
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
So I make no apologies, crooked policies
We playing for property, no Monopoly
They say the child shall lead
Shall we dance with the devil for a beat
Do the hustle put keys in the street
Ke-ke-ing in the suite
TV's in the seat, enemies on the creep
Soak it up, it's a lesson, every fuck up
Next day you're down
I'm even better
Best thing about it is
With each endeavor, we reaching levels
I'm Hyman Roth, so made all my partners rich
If you ain't a part of this
As I parlay my chips
Businesses like I'm white
So fly with no fear of the flight, uh
And if you think you can make it this far without a fight
Not always right, but I'm always real
Sweet
I can stare for a thousand years
It's been so long
It's just the fear of losing you
And you've been so long
With gasoline
Red like jungle burning bright
Pull the blinds and change their minds
A plague I call a heartbeat
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
And it's been so long
Putting out the fire
An ageless heart that can never mend
A judgement made can never bend
Putting out fire
(Been so long) and it's been so long
(Been so long) it's been so long
(Been so long) putting out fire
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
(Been so long, so long, so long)
Been putting out fire
Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
The door is locked now, but it's opened if you're true
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
What I've felt, what I've known
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
So sick and tired, I stand alone
The one who waits for you....
Behind the door, should I open it for you? (so I dub thee Unforgiven)
Oh, what I've known...
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Never free...
'Cause you're unforgiven, too...
Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Live your life so you don't see mine
Oh then she holds my hand
Using what I want
Oh Sweet Amber
How sweet does it get?
She rolls me over 'til I'm sick
I run away but I'm back again
I still lie to get a smile
She traces me and draws me in
(It's never as sweet as it seems)
That's how long I've been here. I've been here ever since, ever since it got dark I've been here.
I thought it was my piano.
Since when?
You sure?
No, it was mine.
Where were you at?
It couldn't have been any more . . . How about try, just try 'G' . . .
My mother said to me "You're a bad boy, Louis the Turkey. You'd better, you'd you you you'd better go on 'E' and stay on 'E' and you'll never see the world . . . you're a bad boy 'cause you you went to the bathroom on the floor!" you know?
No, they made me eat it.
Woo!
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la-la-la (hoo)
It's the R.O.C. mami, sing our lullaby
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
Hold up, skip all the singing let's get right tonight mami
But come, get some, you little bums
I bake the cake, get two of them for one
Uh, I'll show you how to do this son
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (u-uh)
Then, hop ya ass out that S-class
Have you in your long-legged life
Look but don't touch, motherfucker think twice
Need a light?
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la-la-la
We got brothers full of Arm'I, mami's in Manolo
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough
If you're a ten, chances you're with him
Sick with the pen nigga, no physician in the world could fix him
He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man twitching
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the R.O.C. bitch
Still smoking that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the forty five
She playing she hate when I'm name dropping
But I got a plan "B" that's planned out, for when things don't pan out
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo
And she grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials
And I rubbed 'bout every essential
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millennium
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la
It's the R.O.C. bitch, sing our lullaby
Need you
Find you
Fuck you
Scar you
Lose me
Smash me
Kill me
Goddammit
I done turned Havana to Atlanta
Every time you think they got me I switch the planner
(You got scanners, we got scanners)
You getting too much bread, they try to jam you
Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents
Except lie to me, distort history
Fine, let me commit a real crime
Out of spite, I just might flood these streets
Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep
Except I made millions off it, you fucking dweeb
Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt
But you don't need this shit anyway, chill with me on the beach
Uh, y'all must want to start a revolution
Catch a body, head to Houston
This communist talk is so confusing
Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music
Oh, you gonna learn today
The world's under new management
Everyone's feeling pretty
Though the world's full of problems
From the park I hear rhythms
Tonight there will be a party
Didn't know you
I bet nobody ever told you that you
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
But our answer today
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Third World's right on the one
'Cause we've only just begun
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
I know nobody told you that you
You ask me am I happy
I can say that I'm ecstatic
We've agreed to get together
When you're moving in the positive
You didn't know that you
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you
Na, na na...
I bet you if someone approached you
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling
Oh, Oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind
She was the queen of dance
And as the seasons turn the days to years
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away
And as I go my way alone,
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
From this whole world, I try to hide my face
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
I need your love more than before
Without you, babe, without you, babe
Since love between us, no more exists
It finds me alone with these four walls
a modified version of one of Toad-O's big hit numbers.
pooching out of MARY'S moistened upper clothing,
Joe's Garage Band has already recognized her
players on theWetT-Shirt Circuit, currently providing
of getting the details of her life on the bus with LARRY
JOE a letter with this infor-mation in it...
Joe hears about Mary's naughty exploits. He falls in with
the Jack-In-The-Box, named Lucille, who gives him
Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
I've been here since dawn of time
I was born in anger's flame
I am here
Burn your kingdom to the ground
Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, is killing me
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Revenge, just for you
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Now it's come to sweet revenge
That lose control
On your soul
Sweet revenge
I got so lost on the shore
Things really matter to me
I believe we're not alone
I believe my little soul has grown
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
What made my life so wonderful?
I used to wake up the ocean
If I put faith in medication
If I can talk on television
And I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)
Things that we have they're for real and we're losing,
Why do you believe that we've got something coming,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,
In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
All I need is understanding and the right to survive,
Too far away.
Too far away, too far away, too far away.
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Can't move at all
Can't hear my call
Cry out
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
From deep sleep I have broken away
Scream
Fate
Hell
No release from my cryonic state
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
It's some kind of psychedelic experience...
Our body is love, we are eternal...
Omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, without judgment...
Put on a happy face
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Pick out a pleasant outlook
Wipe off that "full of doubt" look
And spread sunshine all over the place,
And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Think of banana split and licorice
I knew a girl so glooming
She wouldn't listen to me
So spread sunshine all over the place
So, put on a happy face
What if I found a way to wash it all aside?
As the words spill out like fire from her lips?
If she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her
I am purified
Inside you
As she walks me through the nicest parts of hell (bitch)
Well, she knows exactly what I can't resist
And if she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her
This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write
I don't know what's going to happen, but what can I say to you? Will "I'm sorry" make a difference? Will it ease the pain?
I'm just caught up in another of her spells
Everyday I hope and pray that this will end
As surely as the blade's course is run
There's a little churchyard just along the way
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
He seems to spend all his days
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
And you put it in your pocket
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
I've started digging holes my friend
Hello, what's this? Thought she'd be a little girl
Stupid little cow, ay?
And we couldn't have change since the last time,
It's a new kind of love at first sight.
Ev'ry meeting's marvelous pastime.
So whenever we happened to met
With a song in my heart
Just a song at the start
When the music swells
It tells that you're standing near, and..
Heaven opens his portals to me.
That a song such as ours came to be?
I would live life through
Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
And the words in my ears
In the morning I find with delight
It will be just as sweet,
So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
Embracing you, this reality here,
Wide eyed and hopeful.
We barely remember what came before this precious moment,
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in
(Keep calm, keeping it calm, keep calm. Fuck, here we go again)
Tranquility ruse
That's what I think
Look it dead in the eye
Trying to lull us in, before the havoc begins, into a dubious state of serenity
We know better
We know your nature
Shame on you
No amount of wind could begin to cover up your petulant stench and demeanor
We're not buying your dubious state of serenity
Calm before the tempest comes to reign all over
A tempest must be true to its nature
Control, your delusion
Victim of your certainty, and therefore your doubt's not an option
So try as you may, feeble, your attempt to atone
I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Oh, stay
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
Oh yeah
Ooh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We both know it was a girl back in Bethlehem
She wore Shiseido Red and we drank tea by her side
Used to be so sweet to me, well
Teach me how to love my brothers who don't know the law
Got a peanut butter hand, but honey
Between the boys and the bees
But you've never seen fire until you've seen Pele blow
And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine
Ashre, ashre, ashre, ashre
I got a place in the Pope's, honey, rubber robe
Ha ha ha! LAUGH NOW! (HA HA HA HA HA!) Be quiet! Von seiner Werkbank zu uns heute Abend hergekommen ist unser Hermann Kretzschmar wolle merm reinlasse? Laugh now! (HA HA HA HA HA!)

Startling the fearful.
Otherwise I can't go on.
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.
Giving blood, keeping faith,
Wait it out.
Be patient (wait it out).
No loving embrace to see me through,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
The damaged and broken met along
And I still may, I still may be patient, be patient, be patient.
And if there were no rewards to reap,
And I still may.
Gorilla in the jungle, man, I don't sing song
Brickatu, brickatu, man gon' make them fall
Brickatu, brickatu, man gon' make them fall (Ow)

Tiger cubs in the club, helicopters above, yeah, dem flex weak
Jamaican connects, Dominican with the bricks
Brooklyn was a zoo, little monkeys swung through
About my issue, magazine on a pistol, National Geographic
King Kong dies on this hands and anybody else
I met a magic woman, and she broke my teacher's rule
The way you treat me, is doggone insane
You didn't come home, darlin' untill the sun was shinin' bright
Try to speak as clearly as you can
Everything gets written down
Just in case they could be watching
Turn it up
Into your head
Hold your breath
The end is near
Living inside of me
I am the great destroyer
Hey pig
Hey pig piggy pig pig pig
Black and blue and broken bones
My little piggy needed something new
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care
Nothing's turning out the way I planned
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing can stop me now
Nothing can
It's a word called love
Oh, this must be the way the nigga Pac felt when he made
Y'all niggas got me feeling like all eyes on me, me against the world
Thought niggas would appreciate what I did to this game
Come from the same hood you come from
Thought niggas would appreciate what I came and did
Something must be seriously wrong with the world
(Some people hate) Don't tell me niggas is hating
(Some people hate) I think
Y'all got me on my shit
My attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it
And fuck being famous, I came to get the butters
Is sort of like Pro-jectic Justice
A peace offering from the gods for the streets I was tossed in
I'ma be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
It's the strengthening of chain among us
Ain't nothing changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon
(Some people hate) Uh, uh, uh
(I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy
I guess I'm what niggas wanna be and shit
'Fore they get to rapping, start believing it, think they're Ali and shit
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
They try to take me out the game but I's alive
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
Big homie from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
It's either that or y'all gon' make me
(Some people hate)
(Some people hate) Jealousy is a weak emotion, man
C'mon man, be stronger than that you know what I think?
Au contraire, nigga, I am here 'cause I earned this shit
We bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggas from way back
Get yourself found drowned where the lake at
And then we're coming where you wake at
Face facts, fake rap cats
Some people hate
I think they've lost their minds
He sleeps under black seas waiting
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
He wakes as the world dies screaming
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
And He haunts you
And He loathes you
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
He sways in abyss returning
He shakes with a torture burning
Sanity taken
(Wake) Winged salvation
(Wake) Dreaming no more
There goes my love rocket red
Blaster bomb bomb bomb ahead
A mondo teeno giving head
Psycho maniac, interbred
Teenage crime now fashion's dead
You can't say we will and not dare to deal
You can't ride the storm without some effect
You can't wave a sign that spells "evil" and feel really proud
You can't say we're one without unity
You can't pray for grace and then smack her face
You can say you're there but time knows how much you've grown
Can you say your name?
Can you show your face?
Can you feel your heart?
Lift your glass up high
If your love cannot be moved
You can't say "for them" and not for who else
You can't serve the rich and desert the poor
You can't say you're down and not take it to the wall
You can't find the serum and not cure the sick
You can't see the right only from your sight
Or is that the way you would want your fate to read
You can't say the words and not move your lips
You can't be a friend but not through thin and thick
You can't evenly share and then grab the biggest hand
You can't say you will and make sure you won't
You can't give up all and then take back all you give
Or is that too much to ask of the you in you?
My head's bowed in shame
Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I'm guilty
I wish that I could pay for my crime
Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I felt secure again
I remember my friends, always be found
Now I leave them all in the never-never land
My girl calls my name, "Hi, Dave
If you're this way again"
I've got a longer way to go
Too much in the truth they say
Let them have their little game
Let them have their little toys
Exciting in their plastic place
You're gonna go insane
I don't know what's happening
People say I'm heavy
Take a life, it's going cheap

Not trying to meet the Sergeant, at the precinct
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans
Come down on appeal then I'm killing your pops

Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Doing the speed limit or pushing red lines
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Any nigga ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Ruff Ryder you heard? We got the game mastered
You wouldn't listen
Now who got the last laugh?
You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
Picture me falling off, I'm camera shy
What's the difference? Either way I'm sonning your crew
Something to prove? Spit it, we can have a spray off

Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Flow hot like a heatwave, bitch

When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?
A down ass bitch and she down to click
And my plan is, not to leave this town 'til I'm rich
Tell them get down with the clique or get found in a ditch
Not to hit em, just to let 'em know the sound of shit
And I got the snub nose for those that love to box
All day, 'til it's light gray outside
And even when it's hot, they're outside
And ayo, you would want me on your side
I ain't got it to give, but I got it to test

You know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens
Keep the family then your business, nothing goes in between
Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?

Next, how did you feel afterward?
Were you pleased, frightened, ecstatic, disgusted?
That's what I want to know
Get down, make love
You say you're hungry, I give you meat
Make love, inside your bed
Every time I get hot you want to cool down
You say it's enough
Every time I want to get down
I can squeeze, you can shake me (Get down, make love)
Come on so heavy when you take me
You can make everybody
Every time I get hot you say you want to cool down
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh

Die by my hand
Killing first born man
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass
Why are you doing this to me?
Why am I seething with this animosity?
Terrible lie
Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams
Can this world really be as sad as it seems?
I need you to hold on to
Don't tear it away from me
Don't take it, don't take it, don't
I lost my ignorance, security, and pride
I believed your promises, your promises and lies
You made me throw it all away
How many you betray
My head is filled with disease
I'm on my hands and knees
I give you everything
I need someone I need someone
The Illinois Enema Bandit
Lord, the pitiful screams
Boy, he'd just be tyin' 'em up
Just be pumpin' every one of 'em up with all the bag fulla
He just be pumpin' every one of 'em up with all the bag fulla
I heard it on the news
Just sneakin' around there
Got a rubberized bag
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
Some day he'll have to pay
And the judge would have him for a special guest
And stuff his pudgy little thumbs in the side of his vest
And the judge would say, "No poo-poo jokesl"
Saying "Don't nobody have no sympathy . . .
And the Bandit might say, "Why is everbody always pickin' on me?"
One girl shout: "Let the Bandit be!"
TELL ME, WHAT'S YOUR PLEA?
ARE YOU GUILTY?
"he Bandit say, "It must be just what they all needs . . "
Devil and Daughter, are both on their way
With him there's no fear, of the dawn bringing light
She's hot, evil and ready, to take any man
He is the master of hell, riding again
Devil and Daughter - is this the end
In the name of hell, these sinners never sinned
Drenching the soil with blood, when will it end
He's got the power she's got the pain
Hand in hand with the reper
Uh, yeah
"Somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game"
Pa-pause, told ya motherfuckers, told ya
Uh, Roc-A-Fella
We treat this rap shit just like, handling weight
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake
When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
Ain't trying to, kill 'em at first just, building clientele
But when demand grows it's time to expand yo
"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
I got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk
My CDs is like keys for you Willie's who
And my singles like gems, you know the treys
You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks
Never pitching for a label, Jigga's the hook-up
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Dakota
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key
Now I'm the new nigga, who figured I'd get the game locked
Step right up, march, push
Please, greed, feed (no time to hesitate)
I want a piece of it
I want to watch it come down
Don't like the taste of it
All the pigs are all lined up
Take the skin and peel it back
Shove it up inside, surprise, lies
Bite, chew, suck away the tender parts
I want to smash it up
Maybe afraid of it
Let's pick away at it
And all the pigs are all lined up
Moaning from each limb
Can not swim
Little dog has to wait a lot
And elbowed him away
Listen to him call
A little dog can make you sick
As long as you can raise that
You could have a taste
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Hot in trot
Money can do anything
My small dog, he want what I got
Pathetic little dog
Counts his fingers and his toes
Following his nose
The spring and the will follow me around
Sniff your shit in the wind
Just tell me what it is you want
Follow me around
Well fuck you... bitch
Can you bounce with me, bounce with me, with me with me
Can you bounce with me, bounce with me, ye-ye-yeah
Can ya can ya can ya bounce with me, bounce with me
Ge-gi, ge-gi-gi-gi-geyeah bounce with me, bounce with me
Can I hit in the morning without giving you half of my dough
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
If we couldn't see the sun rising off the shore of Thailand
If I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Do you need a baller, so you can shop and tear the mall up
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Can I get a fuck you
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough
To these niggas from all of my bitches
Now can you bounce with me, uh
Uh uh Major Coins, Amil-lion
Yeah, uh-uh uh uh
How we gonna get around on your bus pass
Can you afford me? My niggas breadwinners, never corny
Not the fussing and the fronting
Get up, get out and get some, shit
Get it up I put it down every time it pop up, huh
I let you meet mamma and introduce you to poppa
Never test my patience, nigga, I'm high maintenance
If you ain't holding I dash yo
Uh!
Can ya bounce with me, bounce with me
Uh! Yeah
How my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes
What y'all niggas don't know: it's easy to pimp a hoe
Before they go running their mouth, promoting how
I fucks with my Gat out, bounce and leave a hundred
It's been so long, since I met a chick ain't about chips but then I'm
So hold on to the feeling of flossing and platinum
With hoodies and Timbs on, 'cause I thugs my bitches
I'm talking 'bout straight figures, if you here, you with us
Now can you bounce with me, bounce with me
With me with me with me bounce with me, bounce with me
Can ya bounce with me with me
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh
Lost Keys
A moment? What's the question?
What's the problem?
You got the chart?
Not much there, is there?
Name?
Did someone drop him off?
Let's get some background on this fellow.
And he won't speak to anybody.
Good morning, I'm Dr. Watson.
We wanna help in whatever way we can.
We can't help you otherwise.
Said you took a big trip
Happened oh, so quietly
Something I could keep
Something cheap
Everyone says "Hi"
Said you sailed away
To say
Like to know what's what
And it's not too hot
Don't stay in a sad place
If the money is lousy
We can do the old things
If the food gets you leery
We could do all the good things
We could do it
And the girl next door
And your mum and dad
Hi hi hi hi
I left behind me when I went out
I hope that she feels the same about me
I know I love that girl
Her one and only guy
And I'm so happy I could cry
And tell her that I'm not
I love her so much
Her and I'm not gonna leave her anymore
When she will love me in her way
Someday soon I'll hear her say
You have been away so long
And now you are standing at my door
You, dear, and now you are standing at my door
And squeeze you, baby, and don't mind
'Cause, darling, you've come back with me
You're gone and now I'm all alone
God knows I tried, you know I need you
They say, "Go on," I can be strong
We've got love to share together
Let's not let another minute go
They say your love was never strong
Don't let them toss our love aside
How could you ever listen to them?
But we can't let them get us down
Why don't we start out a new day
We'll get along so well
Let's try to walk hand in hand
Start our flames a-burning
Get something going
Hey, hey, yeah
Love has always been our guide
Ah, why don't we start out a new day
Our love would be so strong
We've got to make it now
Fuck youuuuuuu!
even if I'm not serious.
Fuck yourself, fuck Yourself,
I said,
I can't say what I want to, even if I'm just kiddiiiiingg!
what to think, and what to play.
Things like.... Fuck yourself
you piece of shit, why don't you just go kill yourself?
I can't say what I want to, even if, I'm just kiddiiiiingg.
you piece of shit,
what to think, and what to playyyy!
Everyone knows him as "old folks"
Just as free as a bird, and as good as his word
Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
And that yellow cob pipe
You needn't be ashamed of him
Way down on Buzzard's Bay
"A whale got away"
Oh, oh, oh, someday there'll be no more old folks
Children's voices at play
The day they take old folks away
Told me when I was young
But I must find my way
Let your son grow
Or, let this heart be still
Apron strings around my neck
I left home at an early age
I never asked forgiveness
Or let this heart be still
But never I gave
I now take to my grave
Unspoken, help me be
And all the things you said to me
You never let my heart go
Did you guess that we've been done wrong
Such a shameless design
It's a shame that his children disagree
Daddy's brainwashing time
She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When lovers chose each other now the perk's are due
She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
Can you sleep alone at night wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Didn't hear it from me
What it is player?
How you gon' say that man)
(Far as I'm concerned, if I had your hand, I cut mines off)
You know hoe money is slow money but it's sure money
This is what you tell 'em
Stick they arm in a car window, drop it like it's hot)
Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Return of the Jedi, from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
Whoooh! (That's cashmere baby)
(Man, shit, J to the A to the Y to the Z)
(Motherfucking pimp that's what he be)
Sure you're right, sure you're right
Check it out, check it out
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your borough and
'Cause I walk like a p-iy-imp, talk like a mack, man
The sweet Ms. Fine Thing puh-layah, sure you're right
Go tell your peeps dog I'm lethal until it ain't right
Fuck if your leg broke bitch, hop up on your good foot
Um, OK, I'm a former employee of Area 51.
I've kind of been running across the country.
they're gonna, um, they'll triangulate on this position really soon.
what we're thinking of as, as aliens,
that, an earlier precursor of the, um, space program they made contact with.
Uh, they've infiltrated a, a lot of aspects of, of, of the military establishment,
The disasters that are coming, they, the military,
And there's a lot of safe areas in this world that they could begin moving
They want those major population centers wiped out so that the few
Hate is a train
And hate is the fame
Rage is a flame
And rage is to blame
And from a darkness I descend
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand
Branding suffer onto you
And holds me down until it is through
And hate is a train
And hate takes the blame
Burst into flame, the bitter end
Yeah, cursed to drown in sorrow
Oh, still I stand
Opens up and lets the wind lift him away
It's just a place that feels right with him
I kinda like the way you keep looking away
Slide a mile six inches at a time on Maynard's dick
Apprehensive influence swallow away
then you're careful grace for sure
Would you like to climb on
Took you out in the back of the toolshed
Now you know what you're fuckin with... Maynard's dick!
Like a child that's lost his way
Then a miracle happened by
And said you love me
Then you tenderly touched my soul
And my future you gave it birth
Little Angie
I love you, yes, I do
Oh ho ho
You're my reason for going on
Cause the tender times that we share
Whenever life makes you cry
To lead the way
Together we'll conquer all
She waited by the moon
She felt too old for all of this
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
North along Riverside
A husband's quiet devoted wife
By the dawn's early light
On a shabby, yellow lawn
She'll drive the big car
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
She'll turn the radio high
Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson yeah
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yeah
And talk herself insane
Meant racing to the light
He'd take her back to street-life
With its cormorants and leaves
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
Yeah, got a little cold
We stuck in "La La Land"
We got the same fucking flows
We got the same fucking watch
We got the same fucking moves
Look, I know killers, you no killer, huh?
Glorified seat filler, huh?
Fake Dracos all in the videos
I don't post no threats on the Internet
I don't be on the 'Gram going ham
Please don't talk about guns that you ain't never gon' use
Y'all stuck in "La La Land"
After all they done stole, for real?
And y'all niggas is 'posed to be trill?
And you pawned all your chains
And took it to Beverly Hills while we in Calabasas
That shit ain't right, Lucian is cool
So fuck what we selling, fuck is we making?
Na-na-na-na
:
Eine halbe Tasse Staubzucker
Eine Messerspitze türkisches Haschisch
Ein Teelöffel Vanillezucker
Einhundertfünfzig Gramm gemahlene Nüsse
... und keine Eier
Butter einrühren
Den Teig verkneten
Sagt die Zauberwörter
Auf ein gefettetes Backblech legen und
KEINE EIER

Half a cup of powdered sugar
One knife tip Turkish hash
One teaspoon vanilla-sugar
150 g ground nuts
... and no eggs
Add butter
Knead the dough
Roll in the powdered sugar
"Sim sala bim bamba sala do saladim"
Bake at 200 degrees for 15 minutes
...and no eggs
You can't put your arms around a memory
Everybody, needs somebody
The lonely days and nights were paved with dreams
We got to get together babe
While clutching to what you had thought was real
No way of showing your gratitude
What is it? What have you got to lose?
What is it you think you're going to find?
Boredom sets into the boring mind
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, the struggling within
Turning it into your prison cell
While you struggle inside your hell
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
The pressure upon you is so unreal
It's the middle of the night
SLEEPING
SLEEPING IN A JAR... (the jar is under the bed)
Streck ihn aus
Streck aus deinen' heinen gelockten
Ah-ee-ahee-ahhhhh!
Rein und raus
Bis es spritzt, spritzt, spritzt Feuer!
Stunned by JOE's command of its native tongue, a gleaming model
(previously thought to be the son of the lady who called the Police on cut
Pick me...I'm clean...
This stuns JOE, who stands there speechless for a moment. Smitten by
May I have this dance?
his head and the yellow chiffon apron, responds boldly by repeating the
so that his intentions regarding the Appliance will be made perfectly clear...
Fuck me, you ugly son of a bitch
Stick it out
Weenie.. .weenie, weenie, weenie!
In and out,
Till it squirts, squirts, squirts, squirts
Don't get no jizz upon that sofa, sofa
SY quotes a few lines of traditional American Love Poetry...
Doing in a place like this?
Wail a minute...
You're an Italian...
Lore your nails..
Your place or mine?
See the chrome
Touch the chrome
See the screaming
Iridescent naugahyde python screaming
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER. Joe and his date an going back
Open door, so I walk inside
And I shake as I take it in
Open my eyes just to have them close again
I twist away as I give this world the nod
As it takes me down and down and down again
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?
The farther you fall
The farther you crawl
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built
Swallow me so the pain subsides
Yes, I am, I am, I am
It swallows me
I twist away
If I were you
A single word
Think by now
Nothing's going
Can I ask you something?
So disappointed
Do you ever want to
You disappear
Superman
To save
You'd figure out
And I am part of the reason
She matters when everything is meaningless
She tries to get away
I can't watch her slip away
She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
If I could fix myself I'd
We'll find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide
...but they keep waiting
It's something I have to do
I was there, too
I was like you
Underneath the skin and jewelry,
is a wall that's cold and ugly
Trembling at the thought of feeling.
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
I am frightened too
Oh oh oh.
Wide awake and keeping distance
keeping distance from my soul.
I am scared like you
The fire increases, masks decay.
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.
After wakening, silence grows,
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Honey, I'm sorry that I had to go
When I was young, I fathered a son
And now he's on the run
But there's not much room for doubt
I asked her folks for her hand
No matter how I begged and pleaded
I only know his name
They said he's on the run
So I've got to find him
I've got to find my son
I've got to find him
If he had had a father there to guide his way
I never saw my son
When he turned five years old
I've got this worn out picture
With no other trace left to be found
'Cause he is my son
No matter what his child has done
Some friends of his told me they saw him
Oh, 'cause he is my son
(I feel it's my place) Feel it's my place
I am the voice inside your head
I am the lover in your bed
I am the hate you try to hide
I give you all you need to know
Mr. Self Destruct
I am denial, guilt, and fear
I am the lie that you believe
I am the needle in the vein
I am the pusher, I'm a whore
I am the bullet in the gun
I am the silencing machine
I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
Finding beauty in the dissonance
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion between supposed lovers
I know the pieces fit
The only thing I ever got from you
You acted funny
You're out there playing your high-class games of sorrow sorrow
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Ah, ah, ah
'Cause I can't resist her
I never knew just how much I missed her sorrow sorrow
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I couldn't sleep last night
Wake up you sleepy head
Shake up your bed
I've made some breakfast and coffee
A crack in the sky
All the nightmares came today
What are we coming to
No fun for you
Where the books were found by the golden ones
By a puzzled man who questioned
All the strangers came today
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
You gotta make way
Look out at your children
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
The earth is a bitch we've finished our news
Gotta make way
Oh oh no, mm
After an argument, that shit's the best
(Think about it while the streets you roam
I storm in, she storm out
It's a little separation but I know how to fix the situation
So I gotta give her thug reparations
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens
You don't have to fuss and fight
Baby let's just kiss and hug
So much love to be made
Girl I don't wanna let you go, I need you so
'Cause I had the crisp tee on with the crease in the middle
On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
Translated it means (hit it harder from the back)
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat
I just wanna make it right (ooh yeah)
Let's just make sweet love tonight (I don't want)
I just wanna make it right (oh love)
Let's just make sweet love tonight
It ain't feel this good since the very first time
I'm trying to kiss her mouth but she keeps turning her face
We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait
You can not deny that, so do not try that
Sorcerers of madness
Child of god sitting in the sun
Fictional seduction
Sadness kills the superman
Of all the things I value most of all
My world and know that it is good
Superstitious century
Separating sanity
Synchronated undertaker
Silver ships on plasmic oceans
Of all the things I value most in life
And know that they are good
Tell you how to live
Give, give, give!
Is showing me the way
I build, you pay
And know that it is good
To tunes of glory, they move as one.
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.
Left is humanity.
There's someone out there, holding candles to the
Then an answer, says that peace will come around,
Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you
Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,
Hear them call you, dying for love, those who know
Brothers, sisters, dying for love, saints and sinners,
Dying for love.
When you must pay your lovers' dues
Cause you've been rightfully accused
That love can't make me weak
And it's hurting me so deep, so deep
Sorry that I made you cry
I'm sorry, sorry the way we fuss and fight
saying goodbye to me
To then become a man
He clearly understands
That I can't break down in tears
When you told me you were out of here! Out of here!
goodbye to me, to me
I'm sorry baby, that I ever made you cry
I'm sorry baby, sorry the way we fuss and fight
If you added up all the good times
You'd realize that our love
I'm not such a proud man
See me baby girl, I'm on my knees
I'm sorry, sorry that I made you cry
saying goodbye to me, me baby, me baby, me baby
sorry, sorry
Stars shine like eyes
The Moon in silver dreams
Light of the night
Of sapphire haze
While down below the trees
Silver starlight breaks
And so we pass on by
Of great god Mars
And as the sparrow sings
Someone else to hear
And so bitter
She gave them all
Dry, dry
We're out to sitting here digging you
It's easy
Oh oh oh, crazy girl
Too many problems and not one thing
Left high and dry, oh
Flickers on
To hide the beckoning of hatred
Throws back her head to scream her sides
To such a strange event
It's tragic
Don't throw your heart to the prowling moon
Why do you stay here for so long
To the sun, to the sun
It was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
I had the money had the cars, the bitches
And the jewelry
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
Growing up in the hood, just my dog and me
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
I said, "Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?"
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
I said, "The world don't stop, I got to keep keep on."
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
Can't be too safe, 'cause niggas is two-faced
It's on
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Seventeen and I'm holding on to around a mill'
Had niggas thinking I was from uptown for real
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Freezing on them corners, still holding my crack
Came from flat broke to letting the dough stack
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
The lawyer I retained you said you leaking some things
I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
Shit is crazy man
We was one step away from taking this crack money
And building back up our own hoods
I got partners doing 15-20
If you didn't snitch, bitch!
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
And don't snitch
Believe that baby
You know I got it
We got the money
But I'm recognizing
Purest feeling
Give in to desire
So tell me all your secrets
I wish I could remember everything she said
Or some kind of punishment for people just like us
The sooner that she gets it the better it will be
I can't live without her
Where has my love gone?
It seems dear love has gone away
I'm nowhere near it,
But I'll blame it on the sun,
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea,
Who poured the love out?
Is peace not here for me to see?
What I am feeling,
That didn't fill the sky,
I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon,
...Yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh,
Whooo! Whooo!
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la la la
It's the Roc, baby; sing our lullaby (C'mon)
Hold up skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami
I bake the cake and two it up from one
Uh, I show you how to do this son
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden
You wanna pass for my Jacqueline Onassis, then
Lay back in the Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask
'Cause this gat that I clutch gotta little red light
It's the Roc, mami; sing our lullaby
We got bottles full of Arme, mamis in Manolo
All attracted to Hov because they know dough
If you're a 5 you know you riding with them
No prescription you can prescribe to subside his affliction
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens
You can't see me, dog; nigga, ya CB4
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket
Still smoking that la la la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle the .45
Forget English, talk body language
Pink diamond necklace, strawberry wrist
Don't confuse me with Marbury out this bitch
Motherfuckers must be smoking they la la la with crack
Let's get back to the music, I ain't with all that
I'm the public industry #1
Now I ain't down with who like me or who like you
But get a pen, I can tell you pricks my plans for the future
As we smoke that la la la
Whoa! Skip all the singing let's get right tonight, mami
Don't come closer, cos it ain't safe here,
I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here,
Behind those eyes.
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands,
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your
From a cross of thorns.
Ring in my ears.
Of, 400 years.
Sometimes I wonder,
We gave you yesterdays, and now you want to-day,
Now all we do is choke, and the words that you once
Look at what you've done, oh, it's a cross of thorns.
Done,
You've got blood on your hands, from a cross of
Fountain... of... love!
It was September, the leaves were gold
We were young lovers
Strolling near
Fountain of love
Do you remember, I held you so near
(Lovers)
(Lo-o-o-o-ove)
And since that day
Our hearts have been joined
Wherever you are
We'll go on dreaming of that golden day
(Lo-o-o-overs)
And since that day, our hearts have been joined
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo (wee-oo)
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
A year ago today
But now you come back knockin' on my door
But I say...
On somebody else's shoulder
And one whole year older
And I don't love you
And told some dirty lies about me
That's why I had to set you free
And now you come back crying
But I don't need you
So go lean on...go cry on
Anymore (Oh, my darling!)
Go ahead and let the tears fall outa your eye
Who cares if it makes a mess?
At the root beer stand
I thought it was sharp
You cheated me baby
Baby, I love you so much, darling
I dig you
I don't understand what it is
I got my hair processed
I bought a new pair of shoes
And we went out to get a Coca-Cola...
Thank you!
Love of my life, don't ever go
Love, love of my life
Stars in the sky
Tell me you need me
(Don't say it)
(Love)
Don't ever leave me
I love you so
Don't ever go
What was it like to see,
Suddenly look away,
Eleven and she was gone.
Eleven is standing still,
By coming home.
Opening me within a gesture.
Showing me where it all began,
He was too scarred to realize,
Under a dead Ohio sky,
Defending his light and wondering,
Sleeping lost and numb
I am wide awake and heading,
I wish that I could see you,
Dreams are fading,
Carry me into the light.
Enduring a memory.
Hold your light.
Hold it,
Hold your light,
By step,
I'll move,
As soon as pain allows so we can,
And both move on together.
Your light,
By inch by loaded memory 'til
And one are one,
Child,
I'm heading back home...
It's all served up on a gold plated plate
Your face is normal that's the way you're bred
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel
What you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
You sit there watch it all burn down
You play your life to a different sound
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere
Where the heroes sit by the river
You stand there captain we all look
You are the champion in the Acme form book
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing
You had all of them on your side
You believed in all your lies
He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
You know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
In my fucking world is wearing your disease
How'd you get so strong?
How'd it get so long?
You had to covet what was mine
He's an infector serving his shit to his flies
When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
To a place I hoped it would never go
Much more than you'll ever know
And what you gave to me
You know I can see
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop
Riding on a golden horse
Happy at the sound of your voice
Or banish wicked giants from the land
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave
'Til the day my dream cascades around me
'Til that day, you'll run to many other men
Tell them that I've got a dream
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
Tell them I will live my dream
But don't forget your date with me
with yesterday
At least that's how it used to be
More special to us than we
As a flower blooms in spring
But the loser is the fool who doesn't play
If she breaks your heart
Cause I may not be around to do the things
And if you awake to find you're lost
Cause the love I felt inside
There was a time when forever
Laughing, loving, sharing, caring
But I kept on building the dream world
Sorry, I'm sadly mistaken
Has turned into a mere goodbye
My love is gone away with yesterday, my love is gone
Puts you in super over drive
Insanely staring with wide eyes
Ain't my idea of having fun
Your super nightmare's just begun
Your love affair with it won't last
And in the end you're gonna crash
You look just like a dead man alive
You sit and wait at Hell's fiery gate
Ha-Ha-Ha
You never sleep you just keep goin
Each time you're dying without knowing
I can tell you've sold your soul and hell is where you're going
Hello Jesus
Jesus loves you
Are you hearing
Are you feeling
Are you hearing, praying, feeling
You'd better tell
And if you lie
Tell me!
Holly roller
Like a soldier ?
Are you standing for everything you talk about ?
Tanscen
Dental meditation
Speaks of
Inner preservation
Transcendental meditation gives you peace of mind
Tell 'em
Don't tell lies
Tell 'em Jesus
If you're able
Are you playing your cards
Yeah...
Hey hey
Hey hey hey
Jesus died on
Mary
Looking at you
Looking at him
Tell your story fast...
Yeah, tell your story
Yeah, tell your story, story!
Wish I may, wish I might
Are you satisfied?
You dig to make your name
All the wants you waste
And you break your crown
Just want one thing
King Nothing?
A heart as hard as gold
You wish your life away
Have this wish I wish tonight
Careful what you wish
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Nothing
Off to never-never land
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more
But I can see right through it all, it's the way to have a child
She's looking to love you
Just turn your head and walk away
She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all
I've never been lonely, and I can't imagine why
Can't see her fire
It's rising higher
Walk on by!
Oh, walk on by, walk away!
You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher
What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker
Who you been with? Chain snatching, jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or something
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder
Phase one of the takeover, the break's over
Banging to the hearse where my doctors hand
They wanna see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Rep ya game pros
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
You call the order, I'll be in Hell
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
Millionaire that flow like water, rap niggas running
Point the MAC at ya, niggas caught up
Like a compound fracture, can't fuck with it
Affiliated with the sets, TECs, honies and thugs
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
Moving with speed, tried to play Superman
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaohs of Egypt
Keeping my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16s
Holding, share these shots with you like a secret
Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
I got ya screwface in forty-two ways
"Show Me The Money" like Clue tapes
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foaming
Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Keep squeezing, fuck it, I leave the whole street wheezing
Got 'em scared to drop like soap in jail
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Roc-A-Fella family
'Cause tragedy thrills me.
It happens to be like:
"Drowned by the ocean",
"She used a poison in his tea",
That's my kind of story.
Don't look at me like
Frown out your one face
Stare like a junkie
Stare like a zombie
Holds her child,
Hands to the sky,
'Cause I need to watch things die from a distance.
You all need it too.
Why can't we just admit it?
Neither the brave nor bold
I need to watch things die from a good safe distance.
So, why can't we just admit it?
Drum on grave and ground.
Carnivore and voyeur.
Sing to the death rattle.
Credulous at best, your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of men.
Shouldn't have to say it all again.
Devour to survive.
We all feed on tragedy.
Much better you than I.
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,
Tonight.
That holds the knife,
Feeds the life.
Were able,
Rocks the cradle.
Like the passing of the sweetest soul, that looked
It's the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand that
Concentration Moon
Over the camp in the valley
(OH WHAT A)
Wish I was back in the alley
Still running free:
Hair growing out
(That's right, you heard right:
AMERICAN WAY
Thousands of creeps
Try and explain
Driven insane
Gotta go bye bye
COP KILL A CREEP! pow pow pow
Used to be a bunch of assholes that lived in this part of the building here, but we systematically removed them like you would any kind of termite or roach
That there's a right and wrong
Who dare to cross the line
For jerk-offs just like you
I'm tired of waiting
I should play God
Tired of waiting
Our course of action
It's only wrong if you get caught
My course of action
And just shoot you myself
Shoot it
Fuck it
They knock on your door
They tell you it's time to pray
And tell you to read
People say they live dangerously
But they will walk their lives
They will walk their lives
Of truth into your life
You run from their sight
They sing and they chant
In tongues you have never heard
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
Walk on ...
And airports of tents
They have no defense
And knowing the Almighty Friend
Come on and shine that light through the day through the night
Not to hear the holy word
Yeah DJ Clue! A/K/A/, William, M. Holla
The world's most infamous
Roc-A-Fella Records, c'mon
Stick to the script!
Remember where you heard it first stupid!
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script
YO, they call me William H. (H!) the all-time great (great!)
I rock my jewels (jewels!) I'm not a fool (fool!)
When I'm skating through the city and I stop and kick it
Never talk like a mime I gotta watch you snitches
Eat nigga, let it stick to your ribs
To the man, seen a Sammy the Bull emerge on the stand
We lost Ty and E, but we still eating though
'Til we reach Malik or the date of E's release
To this freak, breathe mami this is good weed mami
We aim, we shoot; y'all shoot aim, we stick to the script
"You can bullshit with rap if you want, muh'fuckers"
"Y'all niggas truly ain't ready for this Dynasty thing"
Yeah, money over bitches nigga
Stick to the script, yo
I don't give a whore jack, man they all say that Mack be fronting
Take the heat, beat your feet bitch, skate in the wind
You can be my ho, bitch, I can't make you my friend
Mack'll, stick to the script, and stick to the flip
I got a sick flip game, order getting and shit
Bitch, you can't get at me, shit I get at you
"Shake that ass (yeah), watch yourself
Fuck a dirty bitch (yeah), man, I roll with a sturdy click
Slide a bitch what? Slide a bitch shit
Ain't no time to stick around and play step pops
Low price, quick flip, 2-8-K quick
We get knocked, we never snitch, c'mon
When there's so much going on down the other side
And problems don't exist
It goes way back to the time when I was very small
You can always look at the negative
So I try everyday to live that way
Some people live in what was and what they could have been
And be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way
And very happy with just breathing in and out
They'll say "naw that's OK"
'Cause I do know the real on the flipside
When I see the morning
I joy in the blessing
And for the people
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be
Some ask me why I'm such an optimist
From what's in seventy-five percent of what we read, hear and view
Who use to always say when she was living
I'm saying sometimes life can't be rough
Long as my heart beats I ain't giving up
When people ask me as an African American
Is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?
And if its narrow, try to expand beyond the horizon
That stands in our way
But if its about discord, don't take the ride at all
Just joy in the blessing
Positivity, and that's the energy the world needs
Positivity, 'cause that's the energy the world needs
Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
And what of the future, what is to be.
Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
(I've been looking, I've been looking)
For a woman
Not to beg or to borrow
Of losing once or twice
Be tomorrow
And you've been coming to me
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER...Joe has just worked himself into
He begins to feel depressed now. He knows the end is near. He has realized
of The Imaginer ...and ... ultimately, who gives a fuck anyway... Who gives a fuck
maginary guitar solo...
Yeah, come on and come on, come and make my day
Got some hell to pay, I steal your thunder
Bite the bullet, well hard
Too far
Put the screws to you, my way
Talk to two by four
Here I go now
I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Ain't no mercy
Yeah Yeah Hey, Hey no mercy
Do you teach me while I'm here
Then it's time I disappear
And I went on down that road
Hey Hey Hey Yeah, And I went on
Lock all the doors, kill the lights.
The sun beats down and don't you know?
They bring news that must get through.
Locked in a place where no one goes.
They have no quarter.
No one's coming home tonight
Dying peace in me and you
We ask no quarter
What's coming through is alive.
But what's singing songs is a snake it is
They're both totally void of hate,
The snake behind me hisses
My blood before me begs me
And I feel this coming over like a storm again.
Venomous voice, tempts me,
Leaves me cracked and empty.
And I feel this coming over like a storm again now
Slip away, fade away.
Touching me, changing me,
Without the skin here
Under these tears now
As the snake is drowned
My fear begins to fade
I could have cried then.
And as the walls come down and
Recalling all of the times
And will die.
I don't mind.
A lonesome fear
A barren pain
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
By one so small
Hearts of all
You and I may never see them cry
You feel that they're too young
But in their faces I can see the trouble all around
The truth already in their minds
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sunshine
Oh my momma's worried cause she feels the world is ending
Papa's stayin real careful cause his brother Sam was robbed
See how the world escaped
Most of the news is bad
Sad is the song
Everything is happening
Are we all doomed?
Hate to see the babies starve cause momma cant be found
Never ever walks an alley or a shorter way
But could men die a stranger in every war
When the blame we know for sure is right in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves
yeah yeah yeah
ahhh
ohhh noo
ohh baby
and breathing
and sinking
It's almost like I'm swimming.
on the hunter
but it makes me dizzy.
Seems so familiar.
into a dream within a dream.
The sun is setting cool again.
and the fisherman
and I'm sweating,
and sinking deeper
It's the way you whisper.
takes me home
Wait a minute; we gotta get somethin' real happenin' here
We should make this worthwhile
We should get into something REAL
No, man, he's not interested in Leather... shit
Christ, that's goin' on two tours old now...
I am the crazy man
But I think I'm breaking through the wall
Convicted of the crime
To catch you when you fall
But you only see the rock
But you only crawl
All the doors that you keep locked
Let's take it all
By the hands of your emotions
For yesterday
One more crucifixion
You're a hole in a photograph
The city can feel no shame
They call it mystery
You thought he walked on the water
And you were free to run away
Would you get out of there
It's not safe or easy
You just won't belong at all
To the murder of an angel
Go on lose it in the city
You've got electric eyes
I built it up, now I take it apart
No need for me to stay
I put my faith in god and my trust in you
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
I'm the one with this big fucking hole
Twenty-six years, on my way to hell
Don't think you're having all the fun
I want to but I can't turn back
This world full of you
I am all alone this time around
Places parallel I know it's you
And on (And on)
And on
I can feel me start to fade away
I will be beside you before long
Ooo beside you in time
A little piece of you
Will die (This is not a miracle)
Blossom fails to bloom this season
Too long (This is not America)
There was a time
For this could be the biggest sky
Sha la la la la
This is not, sha la la la la
Falcon spirals to the ground
So bloody red, tomorrow's clouds
Will die (This could be a miracle)
This is not, sha la la la
Johnny is a man and he's bigger than you
And he looks straight through you
He'll get home around seven
And he could have had a Cadillac
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
And the food is on the table but the food is cold
Can't you even cook?
Well, Johnny is a man and he's bigger than her
If she wears long sleeves
It shows through
And everybody dances on my bare feet
If i'm minding my business just doing the right thing
If a family's waiting for that special blessing to
But they ain't trying to get on their knees and pray
And if we live in a time where every nation's fighting
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
If i gotta get up early in the morning for a job
And i forget to set the stupid alarm
And you come around there trying to bring them some harm
To get me some food
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your
Knowing some would like to turn back the hands of time
Cost me my life
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out
Audacity
And should there be just a handful that believe that
And there's no need to fight for equality
Get up, get up now
Locked up inside you
A cavern of treasures that
Let's go digging
You won't do what you'd like to do
Kill what you want to
Take all or nothing
Take it all
All the way in
Let it go in
Knock me down
Knock you down
All the way
Take it up, take it up higher
Give in now
You'll like this in
You'll like this
Dying and cancer and crying
Just too short to push it
Just like...
Since you printed my question and photo in issue number 29, PFIQ, I have received many letters.
I finally got rid of the smell
By putting a 5/32-inches barbell and a 5/16-inches ring.
(
Maybe I should read the text one whole, because . . . again . . . oh . . .
Don't ever quit putting out PFIQ, as it is most enjoy-able.
And go over them many times.
Keep up the great work. I don't know what to pierce next.
Piercing the head of the cock must be painful.
I had the head tattooed and it hurt like hell!
Choices always were a problem for you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Like me
Trust in me now, don't you judge or question
Just do everything I tell you to do
My God's will
When he speaks
He has needs
We both want
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Trust in me, now don't you judge or question
Down my dead end street
To Village Ghetto Land
While robbers laugh and steal
Broken glass is everywhere
Killing plagues the citizens
Children play with rusted cars
Politicians laugh and drink - drunk to all demands
Starvation roams the streets
Infected by the grief
Glad for what we have
Village Ghetto Land
It's been too much, too far away from home
I can't resist, I'm falling
All day long I'm pushed and shoved
In the danger zone
You know I'm always trouble on my own
I've got too much time
I'm eager, eager to please
It's got me on my knees
Ain't gonna feel no pain
I ain't got no shame
Just leave me on my own
I'm living in the danger zone
I'm gonna take a chance
Help me I'm falling to the danger zone
She is wretched but she comforts me
She's always there for me
And the moon does resurrect the night
Not much good has come out the light
I will run straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
Always return to Hell and back
A lonely light in a window
Tragic, heartless and hateful
And when the night has fallen
When she starts her calling
I become two
Unbridled... unequaled... unholy... undone
The path is worn well
The warmth of Hell
And I send a smile to you
Waste my hate on you
You think enough to even raise the brow
Well I see my hands, I see my feet
Dead gone now
Your voice in fucking echo stereo
Looks like another all time low
See this is where the fun begins
Just wait 'til you see what is coming
Shut the goddamn door
We're coming back for more
Just something to get by
We'll get the other side
And stretch across the sky
We are never gonna die
Everything is not okay
The passengers arrived today
This paranoia turns to fear
Pretending, but I know you hear
(So give me just a little, baby)
(This is gonna last forever, baby)
(And stretch across the sky)
We're never gonna die
Stretch across the sky
Un-deniable dilemma.
Anyone should bear.
But I would not want you
Just not enough.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I don't want it.
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
I can help you change
Say the word and we'll be
Blend and balance
Deep within you
But it's not enough.
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.
(Chupa minha pica pichu)
(Relax, relax, relax, relax)
The way that things have come to be.
What became of subtlety?
If I really don't feel anything at all?
'Til I feel something.
Shoulder deep within the borderline.
Oh it's night again
If the light must end
There's a door to dreams
But with a silent scream
Still you chase what you can't see
And the Shadow of The Wind
You'll remember me
Be where you want to be
Well I'm back and stronger
And it lasts much longer
Never more the victim cries
Like the Shadow of The Wind
And two for sympathy
Then you'd be misery
Who are you? What are you? Why?
It's a half truth, still a whole lie
You'll come, but you know
Remember Freddie and Jo?
(A monster movie);
(Wait ten seconds)
Clutchin' at yer elbow
When the monster came out,
People all around you,
The Monster From The U.S.O.
His new white socks, 'n his pants all black;
His watch is gold
With his arm's around yer waist
An' he asks you for a date
Suppose you don't wanna?
When a joker like that
Oh, baby!
Would you go all the way
For the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way?
If I was half drowning
Would you pull me up
Is it unfair to ask you
The window broke the silence of the matches
Pull me up
Pull me up by my hair
Burning fever burning on my forehead
Shoots out its tiresome message
An island of lost souls
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you still kiss my lips
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
The greatest disappointment
Into junior dad
War made him a soldier
Peace left him a loser
Lines of worry appeared with age
Spent his time in the picture house
The little that he made
Friendless, lonely days
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy
He gave them toffees and played their games
Then two gentlemen called on him
Why was he friends with the children
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
The hand of authority said, "No more" to
Wiped a tear and caught a train
How did the group get together?
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby
Say my babe
She's right there to love me
Well, I love her
Say I love her
She upsets my soul
I love the way she walk
She makes me feel so good
She never make me cry
She's my babe
Than to see her in a sweater
That won't quit
And a tight skirt
People, let me tell you, that's it
Hey!
Oh, oh-oh-oh, my babe
Gracias.
Do you remember the time we...?
And should have...?
I know
How we could justify it all
In our hearts we knew better
And we chose to continue
In the hour of our twilight
And we will all be back together, as one
Shame on us, doomed from the start
Shame on us for all we have done
And you never get away
And all of this is a consequence
If you believe in that sort of thing
When you closed your eyes
And at peace?
As the light starts to fade
That I am not afraid
As the heavens will fall
Will be anything at all
Shame on us for all we have done (shame on us)
Uh-uh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah
You belong to the night (uh-uh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah)
He's a man of the night
I be holding it down yo, still love the dough
Got the whole world on lock down, you know how we flow
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
And just like your spirit, the Commission remains
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit
And I let the world know that the city is mine, what?
You belong to the night (ge-ge-geyeah, uh-uh-uh, pa-pau)
Y'all wanna know how I flow just seek and you find
About to redefine rap mami, either I'm
I read a article that said I was ruining shit
So I'ma hit y'all with these last two and split
Students of Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit
I'm the type to buy a Rollie and just ice my shit
How real is that? My floss game, still intact
Like the first dude to cop the 850 in '89
You belong to the city (the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (pa-pause, feel me)
I snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough
I make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks
Got your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent
So I could be in a dark corner, all in her butt
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name
From now until they blow holes in my frame
I'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime
You belong to the night (ah ah, the city is mine)
He's the man of the night (the city is mine, is mine, is mine, is mine)
You belong to the night
You belong
Y'all know who it is (He's back)
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Niggas, don't be scared to grab her from behind
Now what the fuck they're gon' do with me?
Real as banana clips, I got a zoo with me
Now how the fuck they're gon' deal with me?
Got the whole BK ready to kill with me
Now what the fuck they're gon' say to me?
Don't play with me, clap, ya mean?
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different
Thirty-three Os on a bitch back like Pippen
Thirty-six Os and a ki', you do the addition
I was moving birds like a Oriole fitted
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
Homie, don't be scared to grab it from behind
Got your hair did and your favorite shoes
You need a baller like I, call 'em like I
Move over, y'all amateurs
Oh, stop calling, that's ho-man shit
I stands up in it like a champ up in it
No more minute man in it
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Line)
You got starch in your flow, I flow too many ways
Rembrandt, Rilke, I am art with the flow
Niggas takin' it lightly, had to darken the flow
I'm too smart with the flow, you just started to flow
I am pro, as you see, I'm off the charts with the flow
In some places they say this, I am God with the flow
Although I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow
I come up hard but I evolve with the flow
Born to push you around
You pull away
You hit the ground
Tend to black your eyes
Keep praying
Waiting for the one
When you stand up and feel the warmth
No, the sunshine never comes
Just stay down this time
Crawl in yourself
God I'll make them pay
I'll end this day
But the sunshine never comes
And never spoken here
I suffer this no longer
This, I swear
This, I swear!
To let me know you made it home
If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights
For me and you my part-time lover
Chasing love up against the sun
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
Just pass me by, don't even speak
But if there's some emergency
So then she won't peek its really you my part-time lover
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And then a man called our exchange
I guess that two can play the game
You and me, part-time lovers
All that is, was and will be
Time and space never ending
Limitations of human understanding
Obligation to survive
Twisting
Through the never
Ever was
In the dark, see past our eyes
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
Came to be, how it begun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On through the never
Out to the
Then never comes
Ask forever
Blacked out
The screams crashed into silence
Doused in the gasoline
Decadence
The pathway starts to spiral
All for publicity
Light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Ah, kill the truth
High again
Built a higher wall
Now you're thrown away
Who cares at all?
A moth into the flame
Backstabbing wicked
Perjurer
Seduce you into ruin
Built the higher wall
Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
Overdose on shame and insecurity
Death scene
A grave filled with seduction
Fame does the murdering
So light it up
Addicted to the
It keeps growing
I have been trying
To tolerate you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I thought maybe
But it continues
Stronger
And I will use my fist
Everything I can
Now I know
Exactly what I am
Inside of me
H to the izz-O V to the izz-A
The flow o' the century oh it's timeless Hov'!
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Wasn't born hustlers I was burping 'em
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me
So poof vamoose son of a bitch
Not guilty ya'll got-ta feel me
Holler at me
To let 'em know what a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Industry shady it need to be taken over
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks
Hove is back, life stories told through rap
Like I told you sell drugs no
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
So you know I seen it all before
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
What else can I say about dude, I gets bizzay
Gimme fire
Ooh!
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
And I see red
War horse, warhead
Through black and white
Fuel is pumping engines
And on I burn
Quench my thirst with gasoline
Turn on beyond the bone
Burn your face upon the chrome
Headlights, head on, headlines
Yeah lives way too fast, fast, fast, oohhOH!
White knuckle tight!
I left my heart, in San Francisco
To be where little cable cars
The morning fog may chill the air
In San Francisco
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Will shine for me, oh, oh
Shiruetto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru
Silhouettes and shadows
No more free steps to heaven!
Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Doko ni kyokun wa arunoka hitobito wa yubi o orareteiru
I am bored from the event
And it's no game
Couples 'gainst the target
And it breaks into pieces
And it's all so much scarier
And it makes all the papers
Hyoteki o se ni shita koibito tachi
Kino ni huta o sureba kyohu wa masu
Shinbun wa kaki tateru
When people have their fingers broken?
It's so degrading
Shut u
A new way waiting to be born
A touch of love in fear of hate
For the promises of rain
She gives love with purity
To build worlds enhanced by peace
She expresses life anew
She is a flower that grows
She's femininity
Why did they make you begin
before your cycle ends
When the true reflection of you that they see
She has touched the farthest star
And her freedom makes us free
Infinite to all that see
Now there is a sound of laughter
For the world to know her fame
When they knew your love could cast its spell and
Why do you linger in space
You hold a special place
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fire's dead and gone
Where go I?
When you are the ostracized
Twisting of the tourniquet
Bow down
I will set you free
Surrender unto me
Sanctify your demons
You don't exist
The Judas kiss
Intuition crucify
Assassinate the living flame
Bites into your fragile veins
Patronize and complicate
I've become your new god now
Whisper thoughts into your mind
Lured the children never found
In the heart of evil man
Strong and powerful will fall
Inside you all
Dig a hole, bury yourself, nigga!
I got some nice dresses for you guys
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss coming (Yes)
Nothing left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Motherfucker bury yourself)
I know the cross I bear
I'm like, "Yeah"
Won't tear one tissue, no tears, no tissue, not an issue
I peep these niggas from deep
Silent partner, I hear you loud and clear
I'm just waiting 'til you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in
It's nothing but a hobby to him
Niggas like, "Hov', why don't you get at ol' boy?"
Why not wait to catch them all together?
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss coming
And now what's that you talking bout we gon' see now (Uh! We gon' see now)
How is niggas dissing me
For niggas to make history
Please explain this shit to me
Have we forgotten our history?
It's like the disciples, dissing Jesus and becoming his rivals
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Think I'm in the office, I'm off my grind?
You lost ya mind?
I give 'em enough rope
I just kick away the chair
Nothing left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Uh-huh)
No ho, daddy gon' spank you for that shit you said
Everybody know you better, you in a lose lose
Real niggas like, "Why Hov talking to Dude?"
My chain was on your neck, that's an actual fact
That's when ya'll niggas outside of your truth
Niggas throwing Roc signs outside of your Coupe
Cause he's on to 'em
Niggas is playing checkers with chess-playing Hov
You in the hole
The dreams you had were once of love and being proud
But the raven's eyes will show you all you need to know
The name of God rings out so high in your soul
And should we fait them all prevails in Odin's court
Catch the fastest train around nine
Before it takes me away from my mind
Send me hopes that can spin in my head
I can only let you know when I'm dead
It's time to turn away
Become reality to me
You're not the one and only thing in my heart
So this time I'm gonna have to depart
